PROBLEM:
    I have no idea what IDL code produced the power map figures
    presented in article1. This is a problem.
    I assume they came from one of the codes in this directory (Maps/),
    but need to maintain up-to-date README file with descriptions of every code.
    (for ALL major analyses that warrant their own dir., not just maps).
    Also need to document this information with the figures themselves in E-note.

TASKS:
    [] Go through all codes and organize/consolidate,
        remove old/duplicate code, add info to E-note if possible.
    [] Add description of each Map routine below (this file).

  This routine does: ___


and so on..
