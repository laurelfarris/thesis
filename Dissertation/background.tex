Response of chromosphere during flares:
Most focus is on corona, where energy
is stored and MR and CMEs are released.
But chromosphere dominates the
radiative energy budget, so somehow energy is transported down rapidly, and how
the layers respond can help us characterize energy transport and
conversion.% Yes this does work to keep mynote on same line in pdf :)

To study the chromospheric response to flares, it is necessary
to first understand the structure and dynamics of the chromosphere
during quiet, non-flaring periods.

The chromosphere got its name from Lockyer and Frankland because of the vivid
red color of the limb (from HÎ± emission) before and after eclipses.
According to Hudson (2007), the chromosphere is a ``well-defined layer''.

Globally, the chromosphere is a complex, dynamic interface that lies between
the visible disk of the photosphere and the hot corona.
About 500 km above the base of the photosphere at $\sim$5800 K, the temperature
decreases with distance as one would expect from basic physics,
until it reaches $\sim$4200 K.
This is known as the temperature minimum $T_{min}$, and
marks the lower boundary of the chromosphere.
The absolute
thickness of the chromosphere varies in the literature, usually between 2000
and 5000 km (close to the radius of the Earth).

At the upper boundary of the chromosphere, the temperature rapidly increases to
the order of a million K in the corona.
This temperature jump takes place in a region defined as the transition
region (TR), a relatively thin layer of plasma that separates the chromosphere
from the overlying corona.

The base of the photosphere (z=0) is defined as where
$\tau_{5000}$ = 1.
The temperature reaches 10000 K at z $\approx$ 2300 km, and then skyrockets
to a million K over the TR (Kneer \& Von Uexkull).


\mynote{
    What makes the chromosphere a distinct, separate layer of the
    solar atmosphere? It can be defined in multiple ways, including
    temperature profile (Tmin to rapid increase that defines the TR),
    structure (high to low $\beta$), or if you want to be really technical,
    the optical depth at the limb.
    Why is the atmosphere divided this way?
    What makes the chromosphere distinct from the other layers?}

\subsection{Magnetic field, structure, and the \textit{plasma-$\beta$}}



The lower region of the chromosphere reveals
a magnetic network similar to that of the photosphere, up to
$\sim$1300-1500 km. The pattern reflects that of the supergranular
pattern at the photosphere. Above this, the consistent, homogeneous
plasma gives way to complex structures (see \cite{Judge2006} for a
review). At the boundary between these two regions, the dominant
pressure changes from thermal gas pressure to magnetic pressure. This
property is quantified in a parameter called the \textit{plasma
$\beta$}, defined as the ratio of thermal gas pressure to magnetic
pressure:

\begin{equation}
    \beta \;=\; \frac{P_{thermal}}{P_{magnetic}}
    \;=\; \frac{\rho k_{B}T/\mu m_{amu}}{B^{2}/8\pi}
    \;\propto\; \frac{\rho T}{B^{2}}
\end{equation}

where $k_{B} = 1.38 \times 10^{-16}$ [erg K$^{-1}$] is Boltzmann's
constant, $\mu$ is the average mass per particle in atomic mass units
[amu], $m_{amu} = 1.67 \times 10^{-24}$ [g] is the nucleon mass, $\rho$
is the mass density, $T$ is the local temperature, and $B$ is the
magnetic field strength [gauss].

In practice, a plasma is described by expressing its $\beta$
relative to unity (rather than a specific numerical value). A plasma
with $\beta \gg 1$ is dominated by thermal pressure, and appears as a
fairly homogeneous, uniform distribution of material. A plasma with
$\beta \ll 1$ is dominated by magnetic pressure and is characterized
by complex structures, such as spicules and coronal loops.
Figure~\\ref{fig:plasma\_beta}
shows how $\beta$ varies with height
throughout the solar atmosphere. The balance between the two pressures
plays a vital role in the structure and dynamics of a plasma, rather
than the absolute strength of the magnetic field alone. At the
$\beta=1$ boundary, mode conversion can occur for propagating acoustic
waves.

% Structures
Magnetic flux is generally concentrated in active regions, such as the umbrae
of sunspots. As this flux rises into the atmosphere, it gives rises to the
complex structures that are observed as the emission from particles that flow
along magnetic field lines (a result of the so-called ``frozen-in'' theorem).
Magnetic structures play an important role in diagnosing conditions in the
solar atmosphere. Field lines often serve as waveguides for oscillations in the
atmosphere, revealed indirectly by the manner in which the plasma responds to a
disturbance. Structures are also a potential means of transportation of mass
and energy to the corona.


The upper part of
the chromosphere contains structures called spicules that emit the distinct,
dark pink color of H$\alpha$, and can be seen around the disk of the sun during
solar eclipses. Above the base of the photosphere (where $T \approx 5800$~K),
the temperature falls off with distance until it reaches the so-called
\textit{temperature minimum}, at $T_{min} \approx 4200$~K. The height at which
$T = T_{min}$ marks the lower boundary of the chromosphere, about 500 km above
the base of the photosphere. This is where acoustic waves shock and dissipate,
causing a sharp increase in temperature. The absolute thickness of the
chromosphere varies roughly between 2000 and 5000 km, slightly less than the
radius of the Earth. The temperature reaches $\sim$10000 K at the upper
boundary of the chromosphere, at $z \approx 2300$ km, and then rapidly
increases to $T\!\gtrsim\!10^{6}$~K in the corona.
This temperature jump takes
place in a region defined as the \textit{transition region} (TR), a relatively
thin layer of plasma that separates the chromosphere from the overlying corona.
The temperature gradient in the solar atmosphere above the base of the
photosphere is shown in
Figure~\\ref{fig:solar\_atm}.

\section{3-minute oscillations}



\subsection{History of 3mOs}

\mynote{
    When were 3mOs first observed and why? What was the motivation
    behind the research article that produced the first results?
}

3mOs were
first discovered via velocity observations in the quiet chromosphere
\citep{Jensen1963}.

Intensity oscillations with periods of 2-3 minutes have been observed in
the chromosphere starting in the 1960s.
They have been observed
via intensity variations in EUV lines.
In active regions, intensity oscillations were discovered by
\cite{Beckers1969} above sunspot umbrae in Ca$^{+}$,
and given the term ``umbral flashes'' to characterize
both their location and transient nature.
A short follow-up study from \cite{Wittmann1969} revealed
flashes with a period of 150 seconds (2.5 minutes).
Beckers and company continued to pursue these oscillations in
\citep{Beckers1972},
with more intensity oscillations and the addition of velocity measurements
of the umbrae at the photospheric level.
The highest power tended toward the area
directly above sunspot umbrae, with peak-to-peak velocities up to
1 km s$^{-1}$.
They found clear periods of
178 seconds (2.97 minutes) at the umbral center,
255 seconds (4.25 minutes) at the umbral edge, and
300 seconds (5 minutes) in the penumbra.
They did not find a connection between velocity oscillations in the photosphere
and intensity oscillations in the chromosphere.

In the quiet chromospheric internetwork regions,
the Fourier velocity power spectrum peaks at
$\sim$5.5 mHz (3 minutes)
\citep{Orrall1966}.

\cite{Giovanelli1972} reported umbral oscillations in both velocity and intensity.

Many authors have dedicated multiple publications to investigating
this phenomenon. Lites is the first author on many papers submitted
over the course of a decade or so, between 1982 and 1992.

\myheading{Initial interpretation}

3mOs were initially believed to exist in cavities as
trapped, standing waves
\citep{Scheuer1981}.

\subsection{Physical mechanism that generates the 3mOs}

Both the origin of the 3-minute oscillations and the reason for their
persistence remain unclear.

3mOs are currently interpreted as slow
magnetoacoustic waves propagating along magnetic field lines.

Results from \cite{Tian2014} supported the propagation of shock waves with peak-to-peak
velocity amplitude between 5 and 10 km s$^{-1}$,
$\lesssim$ the local sound speed.

Many other authors have contributed to the
current interpretation as slow propagating SMA waves.
Similar results were found by
\cite{Brynildsen2004, Maltby1999,
DeMoortel2000}

    %OShea2002,
    %Brynildsen1999b,
    %Brynildsen2002,
    %Reznikova2012


\begin{itemize}
    \item The periodic pattern of
        sharp blueshifts followed by gradual redshifts
        in velocity observations reveal a
        sawtooth shape characteristic of propagating shock wave fronts.
    \item The shift toward the blue wing in emission lines (toward the
        observer) indicates that indicates an upward propagation through the
        atmosphere. The lack of accompanying redshift supports the
        interpretation of propagating waves and not standing waves reflected
        back toward the solar surface.
\end{itemize}

The previous two points (blueshift and sawtooth pattern)
have lead to
the interpretation of these patterns as manifestations of upward
propagating magnetoacoustic waves along magnetic field lines.

Various ionization stages (increasing T) $\rightarrow$ high space and time
coherence at different heights in the 3-min band.
High time cadence
$\rightarrow$ phase shifts, which agree with wavepackets propagating from
photosphere to the base of the chromosphere with vertical phase velocity
$\sim$cs (7-12 km per second).


\myheading{Phot $\rightarrow$ Chrom}

\textbf{What is the manner in which oscillations propagate from the photosphere to
the chromosphere?}

The photosphere was already known to oscillate at a dominant frequency of 5
minutes.
5-minute oscillations are observed in the chromosphere as well, mostly in
the network regions of the quiet sun, where magnetic field strength is
relatively high.
3mOs are possibly connected to the global 5-minute oscillations.

The 5-minute period in the photosphere has been
attributed to the global pulsations of the sun due to pressure modes
(p-modes) in the interior. In the photosphere, the Fourier power spectrum
peaks at $\sim$3 mHz (5 minutes) in the quiet sun.
This power is reduced by a
factor of 2-5 at the umbra of sunspots, though it is still the dominant
frequency \citep{Felipe2010; Bogdan2006 p. 323}.
The amplitudes of intensity variations in the photosphere tend to be relatively
small and difficult to measure, while those in the chromosphere are
dominated by the aforementioned umbral flashes.

3 minutes in the chromosphere because of strong spatial damping of evanescent
waves with height, whereas 3mOs at the cutoff frequency are not damped.''

\myheading{Chrom $\rightarrow$ Corona}

\textbf{What is the manner in which oscillations propagate from the chromosphere
to the corona?}

Bogdan \& Judge (2006)
\mynote{
    and Tian et al. (2014)?}
: Intensity
oscillations (in emission lines) have been observed to ``disappear'' after
traveling from the chromosphere through the transition region toward the corona
(around T $\ge 10^{6}$ K).
The disappearance of a wave is generally attributed to
dissipation, damping, or mode conversion.
Thermal conduction is the principal
dissipation mechanism at coronal temperatures, but it doesn't affect 3mOs
until they travel a few thousand km into the corona.
Slow magnetoacoustic waves are not subject to Ohmic dissipation.
Viscosity can be neglected for a
collisionless plasma. They canât be converted from slow to fast magnetoacoustic
waves because this phenomenon would take place at the coupling region
(where $\beta \approx 1$),
and the waves are observed to propagate at heights well above this.
This
observation also cannot be explained by reflection at some layer because that
would result in a redshift in the observations, which is not the case.
The best explanation is that the rapid increase in the temperature scale height
causes the waves to dissipate.

    \begin{equation}
        \frac{2\pi}{k_{||}} \gg H_{T}
    \end{equation}

A wavetrain passing through the formation height of line causes uniform lift,
compression, descent, and rarefaction over the entire layer over a single wave
period. Exception to this: strong resonance lines like
\ion{Ca}{2} H \& K and H$\alpha$, which
are optically thick and broad.
Coronal emission lines are optically thin.

Compression and rarefaction reduce the overall contributions to net
fluctuations in coronal emission line.
\ion{Fe}{16}:
Changes in emission line intensity time series as move upward in z
(and hence, in T)
\mynote{
    \cite{OShea2002}}
How high do they propagate? This question was posed by Reznikova et al. (2012).





There are two dominating theories of where the 3mOs originate.


\subsubsection{Slow, propagating magnetoacoustic waves from the photosphere}

One is that they are generated below the chromosphere and
propagate upward. The dominant peak at 3 minutes is explained by
the acoustic cutoff frequency in the chromosphere, which is around
5.5 mHz.
\mynote{
    See appendix or sidebar for physics details on the
    cutoff frequency? This is where my own plot should go!}
Waves with frequencies lower than the cutoff are unable to continue
propagating, therefore lower frequencies (longer periods) are not
observed at those heights.
\mynote{
    What heights? Where does $\omega_{0}$ reach a maximum?}


\subsubsection{%
    Natural response of chromosphere at the acoustic cutoff frequency}

The second theory regarding the origination of 3-minute oscillations
is that the acoustic cutoff frequency is the frequency at which the
chromosphere naturally responds when a disturbance is introduced.
In other words, the oscillations are
generated within the chromospheric plasma, where they are observed.

This theory has been investigated and predicted by several authors.
\cite{Fleck1991} found similar behavior in
both isothermal and non-isothermal models, suggesting that the temperature
gradient throughout the chromosphere does not have an effect on its oscillatory
response. \cite{Kalkofen1994} simulated disturbances from both a single impulse
and a continuous jostling (i.e. a periodic piston), with frequencies above and
below the cutoff. The response to the single pulse tended toward the cutoff
value, analogous to a bell sounding at a particular frequency when it is
struck. A series of papers analytically examined adiabatic wave excitations in
a gravitationally stratified atmosphere \citep{Sutmann1995a, Sutmann1995b,
Sutmann1998}. These studies also supported a similar response to a disturbance,
regardless of whether they were impulsively or continuously introduced into the
atmosphere. \cite{Chae2015} used simulations of a gravitationally stratified
medium to show that 3-minute oscillations naturally arise when such a medium is
disturbed.

While many studies have predicted this behavior,
actual observations of this phenomenon are quite rare.
\cite{Kwak2016}
observed enhanced oscillations in response to a downflow
event attributed to a plume-like feature above the umbra of a sunspot.
