\section{Alignment}

Due to the global rotation of the sun, as well as smaller shifts caused
by instrumental effects, there are shifts in x and y between
images in a time series data cube.

To correct this,
the subset of data was extracted and aligned by cross correlation
\citep{McAteer2003, McAteer2004}.
The associated routines provided sub-pixel accuracies.
This allowed a Fourier transform to be applied to a single pixel
at $(x_{i}, y_{i})$, which was how we obtained power maps for analysis.
