\section{Alignment}

Due to the global rotation of the sun, as well as smaller shifts caused
by instrumental effects, it was necessary to apply an alignment procedure
to the data cube.

The subset of data was extracted and aligned by cross correlation
\citep{McAteer2003, McAteer2004}.
The associated routines provided sub-pixel accuracies.
