abstract = {We present a study of the X2-class flare which occurred on 2014 October 27 and was observed with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on board the Hinode satellite. Thanks to the high cadence and spatial resolution of the IRIS and EIS instruments, we are able to compare simultaneous observations of the Fe xxi 1354.08 and Fe xxiii 263.77 high-temperature emission (10 MK) in the flare ribbon during the chromospheric evaporation phase. We find that IRIS observes completely blueshifted Fe xxi line profiles, up to 200 km s-1 during the rise phase of the flare, indicating that the site of the plasma upflows is resolved by IRIS. In contrast, the Fe xxiii line is often asymmetric, which we interpret as being due to the lower spatial resolution of EIS. Temperature estimates from SDO/AIA and Hinode/XRT show that hot emission (log(T[K]) {\textgreater} 7.2) is first concentrated at the footpoints before filling the loops. Density-sensitive lines from IRIS and EIS give estimates of electron number density of 1012 cm-3 in the transition region lines and 1010 cm-3 in the coronal lines during the impulsive phase. In order to compare the observational results against theoretical predictions, we have run a simulation of a flare loop undergoing heating using the HYDRAD 1D hydro code. We find that the simulated plasma parameters are close to the observed values that are obtained with IRIS, Hinode, and AIA. These results support an electron beam heating model rather than a purely thermal conduction model as the driving mechanism for this flare.},

@article{Janvier2014,
abstract = {We present for the first time the evolution of the photospheric electric currents during an eruptive X-class flare, accurately predicted by the standard three-dimensional (3D) flare model. We analyze this evolution for the 2011 February 15 flare using Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager/Solar Dynamics Observatory magnetic observations and find that localized currents in J-shaped ribbons increase to double their pre-flare intensity. Our 3D flare model, developed with the OHM code, suggests that these current ribbons, which develop at the location of extreme ultraviolet brightenings seen with Atmospheric Imaging Assembly imagery, are driven by the collapse of the flare's coronal current layer. These findings of increased currents restricted in localized ribbons are consistent with the overall free energy decrease during a flare, and the shapes of these ribbons also give an indication of how twisted the erupting flux rope is. Finally, this study further enhances the close correspondence obtained between the theoretical predictions of the standard 3D model and flare observations, indicating that the main key physical elements are incorporated in the model.},

@article{Jakimiec2012,
abstract = {In our recent paper (Solar Physics 261, 233) we investigated quasi-periodic oscillations of hard X-rays during impulsive phase of solar flares. We have come to conclusion that they are caused by magnetosonic oscillations of magnetic traps within the volume of hard-X-ray (HXR) loop-top sources. In the present paper we investigate four flares which show clear quasi-periodic sequences of HXR pulses. We also describe our phenomenological model of oscillating magnetic traps to show that it can explain observed properties of HXR oscillations. Main results are the following: 1. We have found that low-amplitude quasi-periodic oscillations occur before impulsive phase of some flares. 2. We have found that quasi-period of the oscillations can change in some flares. We interpret this as being due to changes of the length of oscillating magnetic traps. 3. During impulsive phase a significant part of the energy of accelerated (non-thermal) electrons is deposited within the HXR loop-top source. 4. Our analysis suggests that quick development of impulsive phase is due to feedback between pulses of the pressure of accelerated electrons and the amplitude of magnetic-trap oscillation. 5. We have also determined electron number density and magnetic filed strength for HXR loop-top sources of several flares. The values fall within the limits of {\$}N \backslashapprox (2 -15) \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}{\$} cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}, {\$}B \backslashapprox (45 - 130){\$} gauss.},

abstract = {We present observations of distinct UV spectral properties at different locations during an atypical X-shaped flare (SOL2014-11-09T15:32) observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). In this flare, four chromospheric ribbons appear and converge at an X-point where a separator is anchored. Above the X-point, two sets of non-coplanar coronal loops approach laterally and reconnect at the separator. The IRIS slit was located close to the X-point, cutting across some of the flare ribbons and loops. Near the location of the separator, the Si IV 1402.77 A line exhibits significantly broadened line wings extending to 200 km/s but an unshifted line core. These spectral features suggest the presence of bidirectional flows possibly related to the separator reconnection. While at the flare ribbons, the hot Fe XXI 1354.08 A line shows blueshifts and the cool Si IV 1402.77 A, C II 1335.71 A, and Mg II 2803.52 A lines show evident redshifts up to a velocity of 80 km/s, which are consistent with the scenario of chromospheric evaporation/condensation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved. We use high spatial and temporal resolution observations, simultaneously obtained with the New Vacuum Solar Telescope and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory, to investigate the high-frequency oscillations above a sunspot umbra. A novel time-frequency analysis method, namely, the synchrosqueezing transform (SST), is employed to represent their power spectra and to reconstruct the high-frequency signals at different solar atmospheric layers. A validation study with synthetic signals demonstrates that SST is capable of resolving weak signals even when their strength is comparable to the high-frequency noise. The power spectra, obtained from both SST and the Fourier transform, of the entire umbral region indicate that there are significant enhancements between 10 and 14 mHz (labeled as 12 mHz) at different atmospheric layers. Analyzing the spectrum of a photospheric region far away from the umbra demonstrates that this 12 mHz component exists only inside the umbra. The animation based on the reconstructed 12 mHz component in AIA 171 ∗ illustrates that an intermittently propagating wave first emerges near the footpoints of coronal fan structures, and then propagates outward along the structures. A time-distance diagram, coupled with a subsonic wave speed (∼49 km s -1 ), highlights the fact that these coronal perturbations are best described as upwardly propagating magnetoacoustic slow waves. Thus, we first reveal the high-frequency oscillations with a period around one minute in imaging observations at different height above an umbra, and these oscillations seem to be related to the umbral perturbations in the photosphere.},

abstract = {We measure temperature and density structure for a soft x-ray flare observed by the SXT onboard the Yohkoh satellite. For a flare observed by the SXT on 1991 Nov 2, we have calculated temperature and emission measure as functions of space and time. The plasma density is calculated from the emission measure using simple geometrical assumptions (for example, cylindrical or spherical symmetry). The energy in the soft x-ray plasma also is calculated. Initial results from this analysis show the following: (1) The flare plasmas range in temperature from several million K up to 25 million K; (2) the flare has impulsive soft x-ray emission from a loop footpoint, which is also the location of the impulsive hard x-ray burst observed by the Yohkoh HXT; and (3) the plasma density, pressure, and energy all increase during the flare.},

@article{DePontieu2005,
abstract = {There are now many observations of waves in the solar corona with periods around 5 minutes. The source of these waves is uncertain, although global p-modes in the photosphere are an obvious candidate, given the similarity of the dominant periods. However, p-modes are traditionally considered evanescent in the upper photosphere, and it has been unclear how they could propagate through the chromosphere into the corona. Using a numerical model, we show that photospheric oscillations with periods around 5 minutes can actually propagate into the corona so long as they are guided along an inclined magnetic flux tube. The nonverticality of the flux tube increases the acoustic cutoff period to values closer to the dominant periods of the photospheric oscillations, thus allowing tunneling or even direct propagation into the outer atmosphere. The photospheric oscillations develop into shocks, which drive chromospheric spicules and reach the corona. We suggest that Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) observations of propagating magnetoacoustic waves in the corona represent these shocked and tunneled photospheric oscillations.We also explore how seismology of these waves could be exploited to determine the connectivity between photosphere and corona.},

@article{Viall2013,
abstract = {One of the outstanding problems in all of space science is uncovering how the solar corona is heated to temperatures greater than 1 MK. Though studied for decades, one of the major difficulties in solving this problem has been unraveling the line of sight (LOS) effects in the observations. The corona is optically thin, so a single pixel measures counts from as many as tens of thousands of independently heated flux tubes, all along that pixels LOS. In this paper we model individual pixels imaging the active region corona in the Extreme Ultraviolet. If LOS effects are not properly taken into account, erroneous conclusions regarding both coronal heating and coronal dynamics may be reached. We model the corona as a LOS integration of many thousands of completely independently heated flux tubes. We demonstrate that despite the superposition of randomly heated flux tubes, nanoflares leave distinct signatures in light curves observed with multiwavelength and high time cadence data, such as those data taken with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. These signatures are readily detected with the time lag analysis technique of Viall and Klimchuk, 2012. Steady coronal heating leaves a different and equally distinct signature that is also revealed by the technique.},

The enhanced velocity signals appeared during the rise time of the GOES soft X-ray flux. These signals are located close to the vicinity of the hard X-ray source regions as observed with RHESSI. The power maps of the active region show enhancement in the frequency regime 5-6.5 mHz, while there is feeble or no enhancement of these signals in 2-4 mHz frequency band.

abstract = {With observations of IRIS, we study chromospheric heating and evaporation during an M1.6 flare SOL2015-03-12T11:50. At the flare ribbons, the Mg II 2791.59 line shows quasi-periodic short-duration red-wing enhancement, which is likely related to repetitive chromospheric condensation as a result of episodic heating. On the contrary, the Si IV 1402.77 line reveals a persistent red-wing asymmetry in both the impulsive and decay phases, suggesting that this line responds to both cooling downflows and chromospheric condensation. The first two episodes of red-wing enhancement occurred around 11:42 UT and 11:45 UT, when two moving brightenings indicative of heating fronts crossed the IRIS slit. The greatly enhanced red wings of the Si IV and Mg II lines at these occasions are accompanied by an obvious increase in the line intensities and the HXR flux, suggesting two episodes of energy injection into the lower atmosphere in the form of nonthermal electrons. The Mg II k/h ratio has a small value of {\~{}}1.2 at the ribbons and decreases to {\~{}}1.1 at these two occasions. Correspondingly, the Fe XXI 1354 line reveals two episodes of chromospheric evaporation, which is characterized as a smooth decrease of the blue shift from {\~{}}300 km/s to nearly zero within {\~{}}3 minutes. The Fe XXI 1354 line is entirely blueshifted in the first episode, while appears to contain a nearly stationary component and a blueshifted component in the second episode. More episodes of blueshifted Fe XXI emission is found around the northern ribbon in the decay phase, though no obvious response is detected in the Si IV and Mg II emission. We have also examined the Fe XXI emission at the flare loop top and identified a secondary component with a {\~{}}200 km/s red shift, which possibly results from the downward moving reconnection outflow. Our analysis also suggests a reference wavelength of 1354.0878 Angstrom for this Fe XXI line.},

abstract = {Waves and oscillations are found in large scales (galactic) and microscopic scales (neutrino) in nature. Their dynamics and behavior heavily depend on the type of medium through which they propagate. Waves and Oscillations in Nature: An Introduction clearly elucidates the dynamics and behavior of waves and oscillations in various mediums. It presents different types of waves and oscillations that can be observed and studied from macroscopic to microscopic scales. The book provides a thorough introduction for researchers and graduate students in assorted areas of physics, such as fluid dynamics, plasma physics, optics, and astrophysics. The authors first explain introductory aspects of waves and electromagnetism, including characteristics of waves, the basics of electrostatics and magnetostatics, and Maxwell's equations. They then explore waves in a uniform media, waves and oscillations in hydrodynamics, and waves in a magnetized medium for homogeneous and nonhomogeneous media. The book also describes types of shock waves, such as normal and oblique shocks, and discusses important details pertaining to waves in optics, including polarization from experimental and observational points of view. The book concludes with a focus on plasmas, covering different plasma parameters, quasilinear and nonlinear aspects of plasma waves, and various instabilities in hydrodynamics and plasmas.},

abstract = {Context. The highly dynamic atmosphere above sunspots exhibits a wealth of magnetohydrodynamic waves. Recent studies suggest a coupled nature of the most prominent phenomena: umbral flashes and running penumbral waves (RPWs). Aims. From an observational point of view, we perform a height-dependent study of RPWs, compare their wave characteristics, and aim to track down these so far only chromospherically observed phenomena to photospheric layers to prove the upward propagating field-guided nature of RPWs. Methods.We analyze a time series (58 min) of multiwavelength observations of an isolated circular sunspot (NOAA11823) taken at high spatial and temporal resolution in spectroscopic mode with the Interferometric BIdimensional Spectro-polarimeter (IBIS/DST). By means of a multilayer intensity sampling, velocity comparisons, wavelet power analysis, and sectorial studies of time slices, we retrieve the power distribution, characteristic periodicities, and propagation characteristics of sunspot waves at photospheric and chro- mospheric levels. Results. Signatures of RPWs are found at photospheric layers. Those continuous oscillations occur preferably at periods be- tween 4–6 min starting at the inner penumbral boundary. The photospheric oscillations all have a slightly delayed, more defined chromospheric counterpart with larger relative velocities, which are linked to preceding umbral flash events. In all of the layers, the power of RPWs follows a filamentary fine-structure and shows a typical ring-shaped power distribution increasing in radius for larger wave periods. The analysis of time slices reveals apparent horizontal velocities for RPWs at photospheric layers of ≈51 kms−1, which decrease to ≈37 kms−1 at chromospheric heights. Conclusions. The observations strongly support the scenario of RPWs being upward propagating slow-mode waves guided by the magnetic field lines. Clear evidence for RPWs at photospheric layers is given. The inverse proportionality of the peak period and cut- off period on the field inclination is supported by the observations. The larger apparent horizontal velocities at photospheric heights hint at the more horizontal penumbral field inclination.},

We show that the time scale for ionization/recombination can be estimated from the eigenvalues of a modified rate matrix where the optically thick Lyman transitions that are in detailed balance have been excluded. We find that the time scale for ionization/recombination is dominated by the slow collisional leakage from the ground state to the first excited state. Throughout the chromosphere the time scale is long ({\$}10{\^{}}3{\$}-{\$}10{\^{}}5{\$} s), except in shocks where the increased temperature and density shorten the time scale for ionization/recombination, especially in the upper chromosphere. Because the relaxation time scale is much longer than dynamic time scales, hydrogen ionization does not have time to reach its equilibrium value and its fluctuations are much smaller than the variation of its statistical equilibrium value appropriate for the instantaneous conditions. The ionization state tends to represent the higher temperature of the shocks, and the mean electron density is up to a factor of six higher than the electron density calculated in statistical equilibrium from the mean atmosphere. The simulations show that a static picture and a dynamic picture of the chromosphere are fundamentally different and that time variations are crucial for our understanding of the chromosphere itself and the spectral features formed there.},

abstract = {Stepwise changes of the photospheric magnetic field, which often becomes more horizontal, have been observed during many flares. Previous interpretations include coronal loops that contract and it has been speculated that such jerks could be responsible for sunquakes. Here we report the detection of stepwise chromospheric line-of-sight magnetic field (B{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm LOS{\}}{\$}) changes obtained through spectropolarimetry of Ca II 8542 $\backslash$AA$\backslash$ with DST/IBIS during the X1-flare SOL20140329T17:48. They are stronger ({\$}{\textless}{\$}640 Mx cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$}) and appear in larger areas than their photospheric counterparts ({\$}{\textless}{\$}320 Mx cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$}). The absolute value of B{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm LOS{\}}{\$} more often decreases than increases. Photospheric changes are predominantly located near a polarity inversion line, chromospheric changes near footpoints of loops. The locations of changes are near, but not exactly co-spatial to hard X-ray (HXR) emission and neither to enhanced continuum emission, nor a small sunquake. Enhanced chromospheric and coronal emission is observed in nearly all locations that exhibit changes of B{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm LOS{\}}{\$}, but the emission also occurs in many locations without any B{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm LOS{\}}{\$} changes. Photospheric and chromospheric changes of B{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm LOS{\}}{\$} show differences in timing, sign, and size and seem independent of each other. A simple model of contracting loops yields changes of opposite sign to those observed. An explanation for this discrepancy could be increasing loop sizes or loops that untwist in a certain direction during the flare. It is yet unclear which processes are responsible for the observed changes, their timing, size and locations, especially considering the incoherence between photosphere and chromosphere.},

abstract = {High spatial and temporal resolution images of a sunspot, obtained simultaneously in multiple optical and UV wavelengths, are employed to study the propagation and damping characteristics of slow magnetoacoustic waves up to transition region heights. Power spectra are generated from intensity oscillations in sunspot umbra, across multiple atmospheric heights, for frequencies up to a few hundred mHz. It is observed that the power spectra display a power-law dependence over the entire frequency range, with a significant enhancement around 5.5 mHz found for the chromospheric channels. The phase difference spectra reveal a cutoff frequency near 3 mHz, up to which the oscillations are evanescent, while those with higher frequencies propagate upward. The power-law index appears to increase with atmospheric height. Also, shorter damping lengths are observed for oscillations with higher frequencies suggesting frequency-dependent damping. Using the relative amplitudes of the 5.5 mHz (3 minute) oscillations, we estimate the energy flux at different heights, which seems to decay gradually from the photosphere, in agreement with recent numerical simulations. Furthermore, a comparison of power spectra across the umbral radius highlights an enhancement of high-frequency waves near the umbral center, which does not seem to be related to magnetic field inclination angle effects.},

abstract = {Numerical simulations of the dynamics and radiation in a solar flare loop are presented. The heating processes in the lower atmosphere include nonthermal heating by accelerated electrons and thermal soft X-ray irradiation from the flare-heated transition region and corona. Important transitions of hydrogen, helium, and singly ionized calcium and magnesium are treated in non-LTE. The principal results of the analysis are the following: 1. An impulsive event can be described as having two distinct dynamic phases, each with a definite observational signature: an initial gentle phase, characterized by an atmospheric state of near-equilibrium, and a subsequent explosive phase, characterized by large material flows and strong hydrodynamic waves and shocks. The amount of time the atmosphere remains in the gentle phase is determined by the level of nonthermal heating. Excess line emission produced during the gentle phase is not significantly Doppler-shifted, and the profiles remain symmetric about their nominal line-center frequencies. Emission profiles generated during the explosive phase can be highly Doppler-shifted and distorted, reflecting the material motion and steep velocity gradients present at their depths of formation. 2. Hydrogen recombination radiation, from a high-temperature plateau formed during the gentle phase and from a chromospheric condensation formed during the explosive phase, is the primary cause of the white-light continuum brightening produced in the simulations. 3. A time lag is found between the brightening of the Paschen continuum and the brightening of the near wings of H$\alpha$, in the sense that the line wings brighten immediately, but the continuum first undergoes a slight dimming, followed eventually by a brightening. The continuum behavior is controlled by the trade-off between increased photoionization from enhanced populations of the excited states of hydrogen and increased electron density, which promotes recombination. 4. During the impulsive phase, when the accelerated electrons are directly heating the upper chromosphere, the contribution of the thermal soft X-rays to the overall energy balance in the lower atmosphere is negligible.},

abstract = {The O I 135.56nm line is covered by NASA's Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) small explorer mission which studies how the solar atmosphere is energized. We here study the formation and diagnostic potential of this line by means of non-LTE modelling employing both 1D semi-empirical and 3D radiation- Magneto Hydrodynamic (RMHD) models. We study the basic formation mechanisms and derive a quintessen- tial model atom that incorporates the essential atomic physics for the formation of the OI 135.56nm line. This atomic model has 16 levels and describes recombination cascades through highly excited levels by effective recombination rates. The ionization balance O I/O II is set by the hydrogen ionization balance through charge exchange reactions. The emission in the O I 135.56nm line is dominated by a recombination cascade and the line is optically thin. The Doppler shift of the maximum emission correlates strongly with the vertical velocity in its line forming region, which is typically located at 1.0 – 1.5Mmheight. The total intensity of the line emis- sion is correlated with the square of the electron density. Since theOI 135.56nm line is optically thin, the width of the emission line is a very good diagnostic of non-thermal velocities. We conclude that theOI 135.56nm line is an excellent probe of the middle chromosphere, and compliments other powerful chromospheric diagnostics of IRIS such as the Mg II h {\&} k lines and the C II lines around 133.5 nm.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature. We present a seismological method for probing the solar atmosphere above sunspot umbrae with three-minute oscillations. Our technique allows us to estimate both the vertical distance between atmospheric layers and the wave-propagation speed, without specifying any additional parameters, in particular, the phase speed of the wave or the emission formation heights. Our method uses the projected wave paths of slow magnetohydrodynamic waves that propagate through the atmospheric layers of different heights and are guided by the magnetic field. The length of the projected wave path depends upon the distance between the layers and the inclination angle of the magnetic field with respect to the line of sight, allowing us to estimate the distance between the layers from measured projected wave paths and the local magnetic-field vector. In turn, the wave-propagation delay registered at different heights allows for the calculation of the phase speed. We estimated the vertical distance between the emission layers at the temperature minimum (1600 {\AA}) and transition region (304 {\AA}), as well as the average phase speed above the sunspot umbrae, for three active regions. We found that the distance between the 1600 {\AA} emission layer and the transition region above the sunspot umbrae lies in the range of 500 – 800 km. The average phase speed between these layers was found to be about 30 km s −1 , giving a sound speed of 6 km s −1 . The temperature between the layers has been roughly estimated as 3000 K and corresponds to the region of the temperature minimum. The results obtained are consistent with the semiempirical model of the sunspot-umbrae atmosphere by Fontenla et al. (Astrophys. J.707, 482, 2009).},

@article{Priest2017,
abstract = {The nature of three-dimensional reconnection when a twisted flux tube erupts during an eruptive flare or coronal mass ejection is considered. The reconnection has two phases: first of all, 3D "zipper reconnection" propagates along the initial coronal arcade, parallel to the polarity inversion line (PIL), then subsequent quasi-2D "main phase reconnection" in the low corona around a flux rope during its eruption produces coronal loops and chromospheric ribbons that propagate away from the PIL in a direction normal to it. One scenario starts with a sheared arcade: the zipper reconnection creates a twisted flux rope of roughly one turn ({\$}2\backslashpi{\$} radians of twist), and then main phase reconnection builds up the bulk of the erupting flux rope with a relatively uniform twist of a few turns. A second scenario starts with a pre-existing flux rope under the arcade. Here the zipper phase can create a core with many turns that depend on the ratio of the magnetic fluxes in the newly formed flare ribbons and the new flux rope. Main phase reconnection then adds a layer of roughly uniform twist to the twisted central core. Both phases and scenarios are modeled in a simple way that assumes the initial magnetic flux is fragmented along the PIL. The model uses conservation of magnetic helicity and flux, together with equipartition of magnetic helicity, to deduce the twist of the erupting flux rope in terms the geometry of the initial configuration. Interplanetary observations show some flux ropes have a fairly uniform twist, which could be produced when the zipper phase and any pre-existing flux rope possess small or moderate twist (up to one or two turns). Other interplanetary flux ropes have highly twisted cores (up to five turns), which could be produced when there is a pre-existing flux rope and an active zipper phase that creates substantial extra twist.},

abstract = {We propose a mechanism for quasi-periodic oscillations of both coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and flare loops as related to magnetic reconnection in eruptive solar flares. We perform two-dimensional numerical MHD simulations of magnetic flux rope eruption, with three different values of the global Lundquist number. In the low Lundquist number run, no oscillatory behavior is found. In the moderate Lunquist number run, on the other hand, quasi-periodic oscillations are excited both at the bottom of the flux rope and at the flare loop-top. In the high Lundquist number run, quasi-periodic oscillations are also excited; in the meanwhile, the dynamics become turbulent due to the formation of multiple plasmoids in the reconnection current sheet. In high and moderate Lundquist number runs, thin reconnection jet collide with the flux rope bottom or flare loop-top and dig them deeply. Steep oblique shocks are formed as termination shocks where reconnection jet is bent (rather than decelerated) in horizontal direction, resulting in supersonic back-flows. The structure becomes unstable, and quasi-periodic oscillation of supersonic back-flows appear at locally confined high-beta region at both the flux rope bottom and flare loop-top. We compare the observational characteristics of quasi-periodic oscillations in erupting flux ropes, post-CME current sheets, flare ribbons and light curves, with corresponding dynamical structures found in our simulation.},

abstract = {The strong enhancement of the ultraviolet emission during solar flares is usually taken as an indication of plasma heating in the low solar atmosphere caused by the deposition of the energy released during these events. Images taken with broadband ultraviolet filters by the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA 1600 and 1700{\AA}1700{\AA}) have revealed the morphology and evolution of flare ribbons in great detail. However, the spectral content of these images is still largely unknown. Without the knowledge of the spectral contribution to these UV filters, the use of these rich imaging datasets is severely limited. Aiming to solve this issue, we estimate the spectral contributions of the AIA UV flare and plage images using high-resolution spectra in the range 1300 to 1900{\AA}1900{\AA} from the Skylab NRL SO82B spectrograph. We find that the flare excess emission in AIA 1600{\AA}1600{\AA} is composed of the C IV 1550{\AA}1550{\AA} doublet (26{\%}), Si I continua (20{\%}), with smaller contributions from many other chromospheric lines such as C I 1561 and 1656{\AA}1656{\AA} multiplets, He II 1640{\AA}1640{\AA}, Si II 1526 and 1533{\AA}1533{\AA}. For the AIA 1700{\AA}1700{\AA} band, C I 1656{\AA}1656{\AA} multiplet is the main contributor (38{\%}), followed by He II 1640 (17{\%}), and accompanied by a multitude of other chromospheric lines, with minimal contribution from the continuum. Our results can be generalized to state that the AIA UV flare excess emission is of chromospheric origin, while plage emission is dominated by photospheric continuum emission in both channels.},

abstract = {Solar flare emission is detected in all EM bands and variations in flux density of solar energetic particles. Often the EM radiation generated in solar and stellar flares shows a pronounced oscillatory pattern, with characteristic periods ranging from a fraction of a second to several minutes. These oscillations are referred to as quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs), to emphasise that they often contain apparent amplitude and period modulation. We review the current understanding of quasi-periodic pulsations in solar and stellar flares. In particular, we focus on the possible physical mechanisms, with an emphasis on the underlying physics that generates the resultant range of periodicities. These physical mechanisms include MHD oscillations, self-oscillatory mechanisms, oscillatory reconnection/reconnection reversal, wave-driven reconnection, two loop coalescence, MHD flow over-stability, the equivalent LCR-contour mechanism, and thermal-dynamical cycles. We also provide a histogram of all QPP events published in the literature at this time. The occurrence of QPPs puts additional constraints on the interpretation and understanding of the fundamental processes operating in flares, e.g. magnetic energy liberation and particle acceleration. Therefore, a full understanding of QPPs is essential in order to work towards an integrated model of solar and stellar flares.},

Recent work has shown that power-law-like Fourier power spectra, also referred to as 'red' noise processes, are an intrinsic property of solar and stellar flare signals, a property that many previous studies of this phenomenon have not accounted for. Hence a re-evaluation of the existing interpretations and assumptions regarding QPP is needed. Here we adopt a Bayesian method for investigating this phenomenon, fully considering the Fourier power law properties of flare signals. Using data from the PROBA2/LYRA, Fermi/GBM, Nobeyama Radioheliograph and Yohkoh/HXT instruments, we study a selection of flares from the literature identified as QPP events. Additionally we examine optical data from a recent stellar flare that appears to exhibit oscillatory properties. We find that, for all but one event tested, an explicit oscillation is not required in order to explain the observations. Instead, the flare signals are adequately described as a manifestation of a power law in the Fourier power spectrum, rather than a direct signature of oscillating components or structures. However, for the flare of 1998 May 8, strong evidence for the existence of an explicit oscillation with P {\~{}} 14-16 s is found in the 17 GHz radio data and the 13-23 keV Yohkoh HXT data. We conclude that, most likely, many previously analysed events in the literature may be similarly described in terms of power laws in the flare Fourier power spectrum, without the need to invoke a narrowband, oscillatory component. As a result the prevalence of oscillatory signatures in solar and stellar flares may be less than previously believed. The physical mechanism behind the appearance of the observed power laws is discussed.},

abstract = {Velocity oscillations in sunspot umbrae have been measured simultaneously in two spectral lines: the photospheric Silicon I 10827 A line and the chromospheric Helium I 10830 A multiplet. From the full Stokes inversion of temporal series of spectropolarimetric observations we retrieved, among other parameters, the line of sight velocity temporal variations at photospheric and chromospheric heights. Chromospheric velocity oscillations show a three minute period with a clear sawtooth shape typical of propagating shock wave fronts. Photospheric velocity oscillations have basically a five minute period, although the power spectrum also shows a secondary peak in the three minute band which has proven to be predecessor for its chromospheric counterpart. The derived phase spectra yield a value of the atmospheric cut-off frequency around 4 mHz and give evidence for the upward propagation of higher frequency oscillation modes. The phase spectrum has been reproduced with a simple model of linear vertical propagation of slow magneto-acoustic waves in a stratified magnetized atmosphere that accounts for radiative losses through Newton's cooling law. The model explains the main features in the phase spectrum, and allows us to compute the theoretical time delay between the photospheric and chromospheric signals, which happens to have a strong dependence on frequency. We find a very good agreement between this and the time delay obtained directly from the cross-correlation of photospheric and chromospheric velocity maps filtered around the 6 mHz band. This allows us to infer that the 3-minute power observed at chromospheric heights comes directly from the photosphere by means of linear wave propagation, rather than from non-linear interaction of 5-minute (and/or higher frequency) modes.},

abstract = {The described investigation is concerned with the solution of the non-LTE optically thick transfer equations for hydrogen, carbon, and other constituents to determine semiempirical models for six components of the quiet solar chromosphere. For a given temperature-height distribution, the solution is obtained of the equations of statistical equilibrium, radiative transfer for lines and continua, and hydrostatic equilibrium to find the ionization and excitation conditions for each atomic constituent. The emergent spectrum is calculated, and a trial and error approach is used to adjust the temperature distribution so that the emergent spectrum is in best agreement with the observed one. The relationship between semiempirical models determined in this way and theoretical models based on radiative equilibrium is discussed by Avrett (1977). Harvard Skylab EUV observations are used to determine models for a number of quiet-sun regions.},

abstract = {A phenomenological relationship between oscillations in a sunspot and quasi-periodic pulsations in flaring energy releases at an active region above the sunspot, is established. The analysis of the microwave emission recorded by the Nobeyama Radioheliograph at 17 GHz shows a gradual increase in the power of the 3-min oscillation train in the sunspot associated with AR 10756 before flares in this active region. The flaring light curves are found to be bursty with a period of 3 min. Our analysis of the spatial distribution of the 3-min oscillation power implies that the oscillations follow from sunspots along coronal loops towards the flaring site. It is proposed that quasi-periodic pulsations in the flaring energy releases can be triggered by 3-min slow magnetoacoustic waves leaking from sunspots.},

abstract = {Context. Coordinated observations of a GOES B4.8 microflare with SDO's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) on 2010 July 31 show that emission in all seven of AIA's EUV channels brightened simultaneously nearly 6 minutes before RHESSI or GOES detected emission from plasma at temperatures around 10 MK. Aims. To help interpret these and AIA flare observations in general, we characterized the expected temporal responses of AIA's 94, 131, 171, 193, 211, and 335 {\AA} channels to solar flare brightenings by combining (1) AIA's nominal temperature response functions available through SSWIDL (Boerner et al.) with (2) EUV spectral line data observed in a flare loop footpoint on 2001 April 24 with the Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS) on timescales comparable to AIA's image cadence (Brosius {\&} Phillips). Methods. The nine emission lines observed by CDS cover a wide range of formation temperature from about 0.05 to 8 MK. Line brightenings observed early during the CDS flare occurred at temperatures less than about 0.7 MK, with the largest values around 0.1 MK. These brightenings were consistent with the flare's energy transport being dominated by nonthermal particle beams. Because all of AIA's EUV channels are sensitive to emission from plasma in the 0.1 to 0.7 MK temperature range, we show that all of AIA's EUV channels will brighten simultaneously during flares like this, in which energy transport is dominated by nonthermal particle beams. Results. The 2010 July 31 flare observed by AIA and RHESSI displays this behavior, so we conclude that such beams likely dominated the flare's energy transport early during the event. When thermal conduction from a reconnection-heated, hot (∼ 10 MK) plasma dominates the energy transport, the AIA channels that are sensitive to emission from such temperatures (particularly the 94 and 131 {\AA} channels) will brighten earlier than the channels that are not sensitive to such temperatures (171 and 211 {\AA}). Conclusions. Thus, based on the differences expected between AIA's response to flares whose energy transport is dominated by nonthermal particle beams from those whose energy transport is dominated by thermal conduction, AIA can be used to determine the dominant energy transport mechanism for any given event.},

A series of apogee-motor firings lifted SDO from an initial geosynchronous transfer orbit into a circular geosynchronous orbit inclined by 28° about the longitude of the SDO-dedicated ground station in New Mexico. SDO began returning science data on 1 May 2010. SDO is the first space-weather mission in NASA's Living With a Star (LWS) Program. SDO's main goal is to understand, driving toward a predictive capability, those solar variations that influence life on Earth and humanity's technological systems. The SDO science investigations will determine how the Sun's magnetic field is generated and structured, how this stored magnetic energy is released into the heliosphere and geospace as the solar wind, energetic particles, and variations in the solar irradiance. Insights gained from SDO investigations will also lead to an increased understanding of the role that solar variability plays in changes in Earth's atmospheric chemistry and climate. The SDO mission includes three scientific investigations (the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE), and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)), a spacecraft bus, and a dedicated ground station to handle the telemetry. The Goddard Space Flight Center built and will operate the spacecraft during its planned five-year mission life; this includes: commanding the spacecraft, receiving the science data, and forwarding that data to the science teams. The science investigations teams at Stanford University, Lockheed Martin Solar Astrophysics Laboratory (LMSAL), and University of Colorado Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) will process, analyze, distribute, and archive the science data. We will describe the building of SDO and the science that it will provide to NASA.},

@article{Kirk2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. Sequential chromospheric brightenings (SCBs) are often observed in the immediate vicinity of erupting flares and are associated with coronal mass ejections. Since their initial discovery in 2005, there have been several subsequent investigations of SCBs. These studies have used differing detection and analysis techniques, making it difficult to compare results between studies. This work employs the automated detection algorithm of Kirk et al. (Solar Phys. 283, 97, 2013) to extract the physical characteristics of SCBs in 11 flares of varying size and intensity. We demonstrate that the magnetic substructure within the SCB appears to have a significantly smaller area than the corresponding H $\alpha$ emission. We conclude that SCBs originate in the lower corona around 0.1R⊙ above the photosphere, propagate away from the flare center at speeds of 35–85kms−1, and have peak photosphere magnetic intensities of 148±2.9G. In light of these measurements, we infer SCBs to be distinctive chromospheric signatures of erupting coronal mass ejections.},

Then, it presents a review dynamic of sunspot wave processes, provides the information about the structure of wave fronts and their time variations, and investigates the oscillation frequency transformation depending on the wave energy. The chapter also addresses the initializing solar flares caused by trigger agents like magnetoacoustic waves, accelerated particle beams, and shocks. Special attention is paid to the relation between the flare reconnection periodic initialization and the dynamics of sunspot slow magnetoacoustic waves.},

A tutorial description of the basic concept of WT compared with similar concepts used in music, is also provided. Using an analogy between WT representation of a time series and a music score, the authors illustrate the importance of local versus global information in the time-frequency localization of climate signals. Examples of WT applied to climate data analysis are demonstrated using analytic signals as well as real climate time series. Results of WT applied to two climate time series—that is, a proxy paleoclimate time series with a 2.5-Myr deep-sea sediment record of $\delta$18O and a 140-yr monthly record of Northern Hemisphere surface temperature—are presented. The former shows the presence of a 40-kyr and a 100-kyr oscillation and an abrupt transition in the oscillation regime at 0.7 Myr before the present, consistent with previous studies.

abstract = {We use high-resolution Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly observations to study the evolution of the coronal loops in a flaring solar active region, NOAA 11158. We identify three distinct phases of the coronal loop dynamics during this event: (1) slow-rise phase: slow rising motion of the loop-tops prior to the flare in response to the slow rise of the underlying flux rope; (2) collapse phase: sudden contraction of the loop-tops, with the lower loops collapsing earlier than the higher loops; and (3) oscillation phase: the loops exhibit global kink oscillations after the collapse phase at different periods, with the period decreasing with the decreasing height of the loops. The period of these loop oscillations is used to estimate the field strength in the coronal loops. Furthermore, we also use SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) observations to study the photospheric changes close to the polarity inversion line (PIL). The longitudinal magnetograms show a stepwise permanent decrease in the magnetic flux after the flare over a coherent patch along the PIL. Furthermore, we examine the HMI Stokes I, Q, U, V profiles over this patch and find that the Stokes-V signal systematically decreases while the Stokes-Q and U signals increase after the flare. These observations suggest that close to the PIL the field configuration became more horizontal after the flare. We also use HMI vector magnetic field observations to quantify the changes in the field inclination angle and find an inward collapse of the field lines toward the PIL by {\~{}}10°. These observations are consistent with the "coronal implosion" scenario and its predictions about flare-related photospheric field changes.},

abstract = {Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP) are a common feature of flaring energy releases in the solar atmosphere, observed in all bands, from radio to hard X-ray. In this review we concentrate on QPP with the periods longer than one second. Physical mechanisms responsible for the generation of long QPP split into two groups: "load/unload" mechanisms and MHD oscillations. Load/unload mechanisms are repetitive regimes of flaring energy releases by magnetic reconnection or by other means. MHD oscillations can affect all elements of the flaring emission generation: triggering of reconnection and modulation of its rate, acceleration and dynamics of non-thermal electrons, and physical conditions in the emitting plasmas. In the case of MHD oscillations, the periodicity of QPP is determined either by the presence of some resonances, e.g. standing modes of plasma structures, or by wave dispersion. Periods and other parameters of QPP are linked with properties of flaring plasmas and their morphology. Observational investigation of the QPP generation mechanisms based upon the use of spatial information, broadband spectral coverage and multi-periodicity is discussed.},

abstract = {We use state-of-the-art radiation-MHD simulations and three-dimensional (3D) non-LTE radiative transfer computations to investigate H$\alpha$ line formation in the solar chromosphere and apply the results of this investigation to develop the potential of H$\alpha$ as a diagnostic of the chromosphere. We show that one can accurately model H$\alpha$ line formation assuming statistical equilibrium and complete frequency redistribution provided the computation of the model atmosphere included non-equilibrium ionization of hydrogen and the Ly$\alpha$ and Ly$\beta$ line profiles are described by Doppler profiles. We find that 3D radiative transfer is essential in modeling hydrogen lines due to the low photon destruction probability in H$\alpha$. The H$\alpha$ opacity in the upper chromosphere is mainly sensitive to the mass density and only weakly sensitive to the temperature. We find that the H$\alpha$ line-core intensity is correlated with the average formation height: The larger the average formation height is, the lower the intensity will be. The line-core width is a measure of the gas temperature in the line-forming region. The fibril-like dark structures seen in H$\alpha$ line-core images computed from our model atmosphere are tracing magnetic field lines. These structures are caused by field-aligned ridges of enhanced chromospheric mass density that raise their average formation height, and therefore make them appear dark against their deeper-formed surroundings. We compare with observations, and find that the simulated line-core widths are very similar to the observed ones, without the need for additional microturbulence.},

These resonances decay exponentially with time; the decay rate varies strongly with the temperature gradient of the model. In realistic and positive gradient atmospheres the decay rate is much faster than in isothermal models, while in negative gradient models it is even slower. Independent of whether the atmosphere is excited by a pulse or by continuous wave action a similar decay behaviour is found. The response to a stochastic wave spectrum is a series of uncorrelated transient events, each with the associated exponential decay of the resonance.},

abstract = {Magnetic reconnection is a well-accepted part of the theory of solar eruptive events, though the evidence is still circumstantial. Intrinsic to the reconnection picture of a solar eruptive event, particularly in the standard model for two-ribbon flares ("CSHKP" model), are an advective flow of magnetized plasma into the reconnection region, expansion of field above the reconnection region as a flux rope erupts, retraction of heated post-reconnection loops, and downflows of cooling plasma along those loops. We report on a unique set of SDO/AIA imaging and Hinode/EIS spectroscopic observations of the disk flare SOL2016-03-23T03:54 in which all four flows are present simultaneously. This includes spectroscopic evidence for a plasma upflow in association with large-scale expanding closed inflow field. The reconnection inflows are symmetric, and consistent with fast reconnection, and the post-reconnection loops show a clear cooling and deceleration as they retract. Observations of coronal reconnection flows are still rare, and most events are observed at the solar limb, obscured by complex foregrounds, making their relationship to the flare ribbons, cusp field and arcades formed in the lower atmosphere difficult to interpret. The disk location and favorable perspective of this event have removed these ambiguities giving a clear picture of the reconnection dynamics.},

An important feature of this technique is the ease with which rigid a priori constraints can be applied to the data. These constraints make the GA decomposition much more accurate and stable, especially at the limit of instrumental resolution, than decomposition algorithms commonly in use.},

@article{Milligan2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.. In this Letter we report the detection of chromospheric 3-minute oscillations in disk-integrated EUV irradiance observations during a solar flare. A wavelet analysis of detrended Ly$\alpha$ (from GOES/EUVS) and Lyman continuum (from Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/EVE) emission from the 2011 February 15 X-class flare (SOL2011-02-15T01:56) revealed a ∼3 minute period present during the flare's main phase. The formation temperature of this emission locates this radiat ion at the flare's chromospheric footpoints, and similar behavior is found in the SDO/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly 1600 and 1700 Achannels, which are dominated by chromospheric continuum. The implication is that the chromosphere responds dynamically at its acoustic cutoff frequency to an impulsive injection of energy. Since the 3-minute period was not found at hard X-ray (HXR) energies (50-100 keV) in Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager data we can state that this 3-minute oscillation does not depend on the rate of energization of non-thermal electrons. However, a second period of 120 s found in both HXR and chromospheric lightcurves is consistent with episodic electron energization on 2-minute timescales. Our finding on the 3-minute oscillation suggests that chromospheric mechanical energy should be included in the flare energy budget, and the fluctuations in the Lyline may influence the composition and dynamics of planetary atmospheres during periods of high activity.},

abstract = {The solar wind emanates from the hot and tenuous solar corona. Earlier studies using 1.5-dimensional simulations show that Alfv{\'{e}}n waves generated in the photosphere play an important role in coronal heating through the process of nonlinear mode conversion. In order to understand the physics of coronal heating and solar wind acceleration together, it is important to consider the regions from photosphere to interplanetary space as a single system. We performed 2.5-dimensional, self-consistent magnetohydrodynamic simulations, covering from the photosphere to the interplanetary space for the first time. We carefully set up the grid points with spherical coordinates to treat the Alfv{\'{e}}n waves in the atmosphere with huge density contrast and successfully simulate the solar wind streaming out from the hot solar corona as a result of the surface convective motion. The footpoint motion excites Alfv{\'{e}}n waves along an open magnetic flux tube, and these waves traveling upward in the non-uniform medium undergo wave reflection, nonlinear mode conversion from Alfv{\'{e}}n mode to slow mode, and turbulent cascade. These processes lead to the dissipation of Alfv{\'{e}}n waves and acceleration of the solar wind. It is found that the shock heating by the dissipation of the slow-mode wave plays a fundamental role in the coronal heating process, whereas the turbulent cascade and shock heating drive the solar wind.},

Three different methods are used to determine it; two use the power spectrum, while the third uses the phase spectrum. The three values measured converge to a common value of 5.55 +/- 0.1 mHz, which is higher than any theoretical prediction. Beyond this frequency, the power spectra still decreases down to 10 mHz at which point it becomes flat, showing the presence of some power due to the so-called pseudomodes which we show are the result of interference between traveling waves. The acoustic power density measured beyond the cut-off frequency makes it possible to estimate the energy deposited into the chromosphere about 10 exp 7 erg/sq cm per sec, which is high enough to compensate the losses that take place in this layer.},

abstract = {Context. We investigate the decayless regime of coronal kink oscillations recently discovered in the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/AIA data. In contrast to decaying kink oscillations that are excited by impulsive dynamical processes, this type of transverse oscillations is not connected to any external impulsive impact, such as a flare or coronal mass ejection, and does not show any significant decay. Moreover the amplitude of these decayless oscillations is typically lower than that of decaying oscillations. Ai Met ms hods . The aim of this research is to estimate the prevalence of this phenomenon and its characteristic signatures. . We analysed 21 active regions (NOAA 11637–11657) observed in January 2013 in the 171 {\AA} channel of SDO/AIA. For each active region we inspected six hours of observations, constructing time-distance plots for the slits positioned across pronounced bright loops. The oscillatory patterns in time-distance plots were visually identified and the oscillation periods and amplitudes were Resul measured.We also estimated the length of each oscillating loop. t s . Low-amplitude decayless kink oscillations are found to be present in the majority of the analysed active regions. The oscillation periods lie in the range from 1.5 to 10 min. In two active regions with insufficient observation conditions we did not Concl identify any oscillation patterns. The oscillation periods are found to increase with the length of the oscillating loop. u si ons . The considered type of coronal oscillations is a common phenomenon in the corona. The established dependence of the oscillation period on the loop length is consistent with their interpretation in terms of standing kink waves.},

abstract = {We present observations of three sunspots made in the EUV wavelength range with the Coronel Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS) on SOHO. We examine time series of line intensities obtained with a 15-s cadence and calculate their Fourier power spectra and the wavelet transforms. We find oscillations in the chromosphere and transition region above sunspots in the temperature range 2 10(4)-4 10(5) K. Most of the spectral power is contained in the 5-8 mHz frequency range, and the dominant frequency is 5.9 mHz (170 s period). We find a relationship between the oscillations and sunspot plumes which are compact features located above sunpots and bright in the transition region lines emitted between 1.7 10(5) and 4 10(5) E;, When the CDS slit crosses a sunspot plume, the bright O IV 5.54.5 Angstrom and O V 620.7 Angstrom lines show clear 3 min oscillations. An extreme alternative interpretation that excludes the presence of oscillations in sunspot plumes carries the requirement that the adjacent low-intensity plasma oscillate with high relative amplitudes greater than 50 percent. We also observe oscillations in a fainter area above a sunspot, outside the sunspot plume. The oscillations seen at different temperature are compared. Using the wavelet transform, we find variability of the oscillation period in the range 120-200 s.},

We focus on fluctuations on timescale 1-30 s and find different time lags between different wavebands. During the impulsive phase, the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager channels in the range 25-100 keV lead all the other channels. They are followed by the Nobeyama RadioPolarimeters at 9 and 17 GHz and the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) channels of the Euv SpectroPhotometer (ESP) on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory. The zirconium and aluminum filter channels of the Large Yield Radiometer on board the Project for On-Board Autonomy satellite and the soft X-ray (SXR) channel of ESP follow. The largest lags occur in observations from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite, where the channel at 1-8 {\AA} leads the 0.5-4 {\AA} channel by several seconds. The time lags between the first and last channels is up to ≈ 9 s. We identified at least two distinct time intervals during the flare impulsive phase, during which the QPPs were associated with two different sources in the Nobeyama RadioHeliograph at 17 GHz. The radio as well as the hard X-ray channels showed different lags during these two intervals. To our knowledge, this is the first time that time lags are reported between EUV and SXR fluctuations on these timescales.

abstract = {We analyze data from the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instruments on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to characterize the spatio-temporal acoustic power distribution in active regions as a function of the height in the solar atmosphere. For this, we use Doppler velocity and continuum intensity observed using the magnetically sensitive line at 6173 {\AA} as well as intensity at 1600 {\AA} and 1700 {\AA}. We focus on the power enhancements seen around AR 11330 as a function of wave frequency, magnetic field strength, field inclination and observation height. We find that acoustic halos occur above the acoustic cutoff frequency and extends up to 10 mHz in HMI Doppler and AIA 1700 {\AA} observations. Halos are also found to be strong functions of magnetic field and their inclination angle. We further calculate and examine the spatially averaged relative phases and cross-coherence spectra and find different wave characteristics at different heights.},

Both network and internetwork regions show oscillations with a variety of periods and lifetimes in all passbands. The most frequent network oscillation has a period of 283 s, with a lifetime of 2-3 cycles in all passbands. These oscillations are discussed in terms of upwardly propagating magnetohydrodynamic wave models. The most frequent internetwork oscillation has a period of 252 s, again with a lifetime of 2-3 cycles, in all passbands. The tendency for these oscillations to recur in the same position is discussed in terms of ``persistent flashers.'' The network contains greater oscillatory power than the internetwork at periods longer than 300 s in the low chromosphere. This value is shown to decrease to 250 s in the high chromosphere. The internetwork also displays a larger number of short-lifetime, long-period oscillations than the network, especially in the low chromosphere. Both network and internetwork regions contain a small number of nonrecurring long-lifetime oscillations.},

These bright grains are seen with the IRIS 1330 $\backslash$AA, 1400 $\backslash$AA$\backslash$ and 2796 $\backslash$AA$\backslash$ slit-jaw filters. We combine coordinated observations with IRIS and from the ground with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) which allows us to have chromospheric (Ca II 8542 $\backslash$AA, Ca II H 3968 $\backslash$AA, H$\backslash$alpha, and Mg II k 2796 $\backslash$AA), and transition region (C II 1334 $\backslash$AA, Si IV 1402) spectral imaging, and single-wavelength Stokes maps in Fe I 6302 $\backslash$AA at high spatial (0.33"), temporal and spectral resolution. We conclude that the IRIS slit-jaw grains are the counterpart of so-called acoustic grains, i.e., resulting from chromospheric acoustic waves in a non-magnetic environment. We compare slit-jaw images with spectra from the IRIS spectrograph. We conclude that the grain intensity in the 2796 $\backslash$AA$\backslash$ slit-jaw filter comes from both the Mg II k core and wings. The signal in the C II and Si IV lines is too weak to explain the presence of grains in the 1300 and 1400 $\backslash$AA$\backslash$ slit-jaw images and we conclude that the grain signal in these passbands comes mostly from the continuum. Even though weak, the characteristic shock signatures of acoustic grains can often be detected in IRIS C II spectra. For some grains, spectral signature can be found in IRIS Si IV. This suggests that upward propagating acoustic waves sometimes reach all the way up to the transition region.},

abstract = {The 2011 February 15 X2.2 flare and associated Earth-directed halo coronal mass ejection were observed in unprecedented detail with high resolution in spatial, temporal, and thermal dimensions by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory, as well as by instruments on the two STEREO spacecraft, then at near-quadrature relative to the Sun-Earth line. These observations enable us to see expanding loops from a flux-rope-like structure over the shearing polarity-inversion line between the central $\delta$-spot groups of AR 11158, developing a propagating coronal front ("EIT wave"), and eventually forming the coronal mass ejection moving into the inner heliosphere. The observations support the interpretation that all of these features, including the "EIT wave," are signatures of an expanding volume traced by loops (much larger than the flux rope only), surrounded by a moving front rather than predominantly wave-like perturbations; this interpretation is supported by previously published MHD models for active-region and global scales. The lateral expansion of the eruption is limited to the local helmet-streamer structure and halts at the edges of a large-scale domain of connectivity (in the process exciting loop oscillations at the edge of the southern polar coronal hole). The AIA observations reveal that plasma warming occurs within the expansion front as it propagates over quiet Sun areas. This warming causes dimming in the 171 {\AA} (Fe IX and Fe X) channel and brightening in the 193 and 211 {\AA} (Fe XII-XIV) channels along the entire front, while there is weak 131 {\AA} (Fe VIII and Fe XXI) emission in some directions. An analysis of the AIA response functions shows that sections of the front running over the quiet Sun are consistent with adiabatic warming; other sections may require additional heating which MHD modeling suggests could be caused by Joule dissipation. Although for the events studied here the effects of volumetric expansion are much more obvious than true wave phenomena, we discuss how different magnetic environments within and around the erupting region can lead to the signatures of either or both of these aspects.},

abstract = {The nature of quasi-periodic pulsations in solar flares is poorly constrained, and critically the general prevalence of such signals in solar flares is unknown. Therefore, we perform a large-scale search for evidence of signals consistent with quasi-periodic pulsations in solar flares, focusing on the 1 - 300s timescale. We analyse 675 M- and X-class flares observed by GOES in 1-8$\backslash$AA$\backslash$ soft X-rays between 2011 February 1 and 2015 December 31. Additionally, over the same era we analyse Fermi/GBM 15-25 keV X-ray data for each of these flares that was associated with a Fermi/GBM solar flare trigger, a total of 261 events. Using a model comparison method, we determine whether there is evidence for a substantial enhancement in the Fourier power spectrum that may be consistent with a QPP signature, based on three tested models; a power-law plus a constant, a broken power-law plus constant, and a power-law-plus-constant with an additional QPP signature component. From this, we determine that {\~{}}30{\%} of GOES events and {\~{}}8{\%} of Fermi/GBM events show strong signatures consistent with classical interpretations of QPP. For the remaining events either two or more tested models cannot be strongly distinguished from each other, or the events are well-described by single power-law or broken power-law Fourier power spectra. For both instruments, a preferred characteristic timescale of {\~{}}5-30 s was found in the QPP-like events, with no dependence on flare magnitude in either GOES or GBM data. We also show that individual events in the sample show similar characteristic timescales in both GBM and GOES datasets. We discuss the implications of these results for our understanding of solar flares and possible QPP mechanisms.},

abstract = {Context. The cut-off frequency of magnetoacoustic gravity (MAG) waves could be decreased by the inclined magnetic field, and therefore, low-frequency waves could penetrate into the upper atmosphere. Aims. We observe the distribution of the cut-off frequency of compressive waves at various heights and reconstruct the magnetic field inclination, according to the MAG wave theory in a stratified atmosphere permeated by a uniform magnetic field. Methods. We analysed the emission intensity oscillations of sunspot AR11131 (08 Dec. 2010) observed at the 1700 {\AA}, 1600 {\AA}, and 304 {\AA} bandpasses of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), and computed the narrow-band power maps with the pixelised wavelet filtering method. The distribution of the cut-off frequency was defined as the median contour in the azimuthally-averaged oscillation power. The magnetic field inclination was estimated with the local cut-off frequency according to the MAG wave theory in the low-$\beta$ limit and was compared to the potential field extrapolation. Results. Shorter period oscillations dominate in the sunspot umbra, while longer period oscillations form an annular shape approximately concentric with the sunspot. Oscillations with longer periods are distributed further away from the sunspot centre. The 5 min oscillations appear to originate at or lower than the photosphere. The magnetic field inclinations determined with the cut-off frequency theory are about 30-40{\%} larger than the values obtained by the potential field extrapolation. Conclusions. The oscillation power distribution in a sunspot atmosphere reflects its magnetic and thermal structure. The cut-off frequency could be used to probe the magnetic field inclination, however, other factors have to be included to fully understand this phenomenon. The existence of return magnetic flux at the outer penumbra was evidenced by the cut-off frequency distribution. {\textcopyright} ESO, 2013.},

The results are presented in the form of normalized histograms showing the distribution of the characteristics. For 18 flares it has been possible to make a quantitative comparison between the footpoint response in soft X-ray images and in hard X-ray images. The latter have been derived from the Yohkoh/HXT and reconstructed using the MEM procedure. The evident correlation between these two kinds of response, as well as between the deposited energies, strongly supports a common physical cause, namely non-thermal electron beams. We present evidence that in the impulsive phase the chromospheric evaporation is driven mainly by low-energy non-thermal electrons. We show that the low-energy cut-off energy in hard X-ray photon fluxes may vary from flare to flare and may even vary during a given flare.},

Computation of potential magnetic fields together with line-of-sight and vector magnetograms from SDO/HMI allowed us to interpret discovered features of spatial structure. Namely, we have found that (1) expansion of the magnetic field lines above the sunspot causes a gradual broadening of the area occupied by the 3 minute oscillations with height, and (2) variation of magnetic field inclination across the sunspot causes a decrease in the pulsation frequency with distance from the center of the umbra.

abstract = {The sites of chromospheric excitation during solar flares are marked by extended extreme ultraviolet ribbons and hard X-ray (HXR) footpoints. The standard interpretation is that these are the result of heating and bremsstrahlung emission from non-thermal electrons precipitating from the corona. We examine this picture using multi-wavelength observations of the early phase of an M-class flare SOL2010-08-07T18:24. We aim to determine the properties of the heated plasma in the flare ribbons, and to understand the partition of the power input into radiative and conductive losses. Using GOES, SDO/EVE, SDO/AIA, and RHESSI, we measure the temperature, emission measure (EM), and differential emission measure of the flare ribbons, and deduce approximate density values. The non-thermal EM, and the collisional thick target energy input to the ribbons are obtained from RHESSI using standard methods. We deduce the existence of a substantial amount of plasma at 10 MK in the flare ribbons, during the pre-impulsive and early-impulsive phase of the flare. The average column EM of this hot component is a few times 1028 cm-5, and we can calculate that its predicted conductive losses dominate its measured radiative losses. If the power input to the hot ribbon plasma is due to collisional energy deposition by an electron beam from the corona then a low-energy cutoff of {\~{}}5 keV is necessary to balance the conductive losses, implying a very large electron energy content. Independent of the standard collisional thick-target electron beam interpretation, the observed non-thermal X-rays can be provided if one electron in 103-104 in the 10 MK (1 keV) ribbon plasma has an energy above 10 keV. We speculate that this could arise if a non-thermal tail is generated in the ribbon plasma which is being heated by other means, for example, by waves or turbulence.},

abstract = {Two competing theories of sunspot oscillations are discussed. It is pointed out that the normal mode (eigenoscillations) theory is in contradiction with a number of observations. The reasons for this are discussed. The revised filter theory of the three-minute sunspot oscillations is outlined. It is shown that the reason for the occurrence of the multipassband filter for the slow waves is the interference that appears from the multilayer structure of the sunspot atmosphere. In contrast with Zhugzhda and Locans ( Sov. Astron. Lett. 7, 25 27, 1981) it is shown that along with the Fabry Perot chromospheric passband the cutoff frequency passband and a number of the high-frequency passbands occur. The effect of the nonlinearity of the sunspot oscillations in the upper chromosphere and the transition region is taken into account. The spectra of the distinct empirical models of the sunspot atmosphere are explored. An example of the interpretation of the sunspot oscillations based on the revised filter theory is presented. Only the filter theory can explain the complicated behavior of the oscillations across the sunspot. The observations provide evidence of the nonuniformity of the sunspot atmosphere.},

abstract = {The acoustic cut-off frequency -the highest frequency for acoustic solar eigenmodes- is an important parameter of the solar atmosphere as it determines the upper boundary of the p-mode resonant cavities. At frequencies beyond this value, acoustic disturbances are no longer trapped but traveling waves. Interference amongst them give rise to higher-frequency peaks -the pseudomodes- in the solar acoustic spectrum. The pseudomodes are shifted slightly in frequency with respect to p modes making possible the use of pseudomodes to determine the acoustic cut-off frequency. Using data from GOLF and VIRGO instruments on board the SOHO spacecraft, we calculate the acoustic cut-off frequency using the coherence function between both the velocity and intensity sets of data. By using data gathered by these instruments during the entire lifetime of the mission (1996 till the present), a variation in the acoustic cut-off frequency with the solar magnetic activity cycle is found.},

Wavelet periods show deviations from the theoretical cutoff value and are interpreted in terms of inclined fields. The variation of wave speeds indicates that a transition from dominant fast-magnetoacoustic waves to slow modes is observed when moving from network into plages and umbrae. This implies preferential transmission of slow modes into the upper atmosphere, where they may lead to heating or be detected in coronal loops and plumes.},

abstract = {The spatial variation of chromospheric oscillations in network bright points (NBPs) is studied using high-resolution observations in Ca II K3. Light curves and hence power spectra were created by isolating distinct regions of the NBP via a simple intensity thresholding technique. Using this technique, it was possible to identify peaks in the power spectra with particular spatial positions within the NBPs. In particular, long-period waves with periods of 4-15 minutes (1-4 mHz) were found in the central portions of each NBP, indicating that these waves are certainly not acoustic but possibly due to magnetoacoustic or magnetogravity wave modes. We also show that spatially averaged or low spatial resolution power spectra can lead to an inability to detect such long-period waves.},

abstract = {We use images of high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution, obtained using both ground- and space-based instrumentation, to investigate the coupling between wave phenomena observed at numerous heights in the solar atmosphere. Analysis of 4170 {\AA} continuum images reveals small-scale umbral intensity enhancements, with diameters ∼0.??6, lasting in excess of 30 minutes. Intensity oscillations of ≈3 minutes are observed to encompass these photospheric structures, with power at least three orders of magnitude higher than the surrounding umbra. Simultaneous chromospheric velocity and intensity time series reveal an 87◦ ±8◦ out-of-phase behavior, implying the presence of standing modes created as a result of partial wave reflection at the transition region boundary.We find amaximum waveguide inclination angle of≈40◦ between photospheric and chromospheric heights, combined with a radial expansion factor of {\textless}76{\%}. An average blueshifted Doppler velocity of ≈1.5kms−1, in addition to a time lag between photospheric and chromospheric oscillatory phenomena, confirms the presence of upwardly propagating slow-modewaves in the lower solar atmosphere. Propagating oscillations inEUVintensity are detected in simultaneous coronal fan structures,with a periodicity of 172±17 s and a propagation velocity of 45±7kms−1. Numerical simulations reveal that the damping of the magnetoacoustic wave trains is dominated by thermal conduction. The coronal fans are seen to anchor into the photosphere in locations where large-amplitude umbral dot (UD) oscillations manifest. Derived kinetic temperature and emission measure time series display prominent out- of-phase characteristics, and when combined with the previously established sub-sonic wave speeds, we conclude that the observed EUV waves are the coronal counterparts of the upwardly propagating magnetoacoustic slow modes detected in the lower solar atmosphere. Thus, for the first time, we reveal how the propagation of 3 minute magnetoacoustic waves in solar coronal structures is a direct result of amplitude enhancements occurring in photospheric UDs.},

abstract = {We have simulated the generation of Ca II H2V bright grains by acoustic shocks. We employ a one-dimensional, non-LTE radiation-hydrodynamic code, with six-level model atoms for hydrogen and singly ionized calcium. We drive acoustic waves through a stratified radiative equilibrium atmosphere by a piston, whose velocity is chosen to match the Doppler shift observed in the Fe I 396.68 nm line in the H line wing, formed at about 260 km above tau 500 = 1. The simulations closely match the observed behavior of Ca II H2V bright grains down to the level of individual grains. The bright grains are produced by shocks near 1 Mm above tau 500 = 1. Shocks in the mid-chromosphere produce a large source function (and therefore high emissivity) because the density is high enough for collisions to couple the Ca II populations to the local conditions. The asymmetry of the line profile is due to velocity gradients near 1 Mm. Material motion Doppler-shifts the frequency at which atoms emit and absorb photons, so the maximum opacity is located at---and the absorption profile is symmetric about---the local fluid velocity, which is shifted to the blue behind shocks. The optical depth depends upon the velocity structure higher up. Shocks propagate generally into downflowing material, so there is little matter above to absorb the Doppler-shifted radiation. The corresponding red peak is absent because of small opacity at the source function maximum and large optical depth due to overlying material. The bright grains are produced primarily by waves from the photosphere that are slightly above the acoustic cutoff frequency. The precise time and strength of a grain depend upon the interference between these waves near the acoustic cutoff frequency and higher frequency waves. When waves near the acoustic cutoff frequency are weak, then higher frequency waves may produce grains. The "5 minute" trapped p-mode oscillations are not the source of the grains, although they can slightly modify the behavior of higher frequency waves.},

abstract = {Chromospheric wave activity around flares and filaments has been a research focus for years, and could provide indirect measurements of local conditions that are not otherwise accessible. One interesting observed phenomenon is oscillations in filaments, activated by distant flares and the large-scale waves they produce. Characteristics of these oscillations, such as periods, amplitudes, and lifetimes, can provide unique information about the filament. We measure oscillation properties in flares and filaments from H-alpha chromospheric data using a new method that provides important spatial and frequency content of the dynamics. We apply the method to two flare events where filaments are observed to oscillate and determine their properties. We find strong oscillatory signal in flaring active regions in the chromosphere over a range of frequencies. Two filaments are found to oscillate without any detectable chromospheric wave acting as an activation mechanism. We find that filaments oscillate with periods of tens of minutes, but variations are significant at small spatial scales along the filamentary region. The results suggest there is a frequency dependence of the oscillation amplitude, as well as a spatial dependence along single filaments that is more difficult to quantify. It also appears that the strength of the oscillations do not necessarily depend on the strength of the trigger, although there are other possible effects that make this conclusion preliminary. Applications of this technique to other events and different data sets will provide important new insights into the local energy densities and magnetic fields associated with dynamic chromospheric structures.},

It is shown that the Bethe-Heitler formula for the electron-proton bremsstrahlung cross-section over the 20-100 keV range of energies admits of a general analytic solution for the electron spectrum in terms of the x-ray spectrum in a form convenient for computation. The bearing of this analysis on different models of flare conditions is considered. In examining the hypothesis that the x-rays are produced in regions of high ambient density, the duration of the burst being governed by modulation of the electron source rather than by the decay of trapped electrons injected impulsively, it is emphasized that the energy spectrum of the electrons at their source is different from their effective spectrum in the x-ray emitting region. This spectrum, at the source, is found to be much steeper than that in the x-ray region which means that the entire energy of the flare could reside in the inejcted electrons.},

abstract = {The vertical propagation of nonlinear acoustic waves in an isothermal atmosphere is considered. A new analytical solution that describes a finite-amplitude wave of an arbitrary wavelength is obtained. Although the short-and long-wavelength limits were previously considered separately, the new solution describes both limiting cases within a common framework and provides a straightforward way of interpolating between the two limits. Physical features of the nonlinear waves in the chromosphere are described, including the dispersive nature of low-frequency waves, the steepening of the wave profile, and the influence of the gravitational field on wavefront breaking and shock formation. The analytical results suggest that observations of three-minute oscillations in the solar chromosphere may reveal the basic nonlinear effect of oscillations with combination frequencies, superposed on the normal oscillations of the system. Explicit expressions for a second-harmonic signal and the ratio of its amplitude to the fundamental harmonic amplitude are derived. Observational evidence of the second harmonic, obtained with the Fast Imaging Solar Spectrograph, installed at the 1.6 m New Solar Telescope of the Big Bear Observatory, is presented. The presented data are based on the time variations of velocity determined from the Na I D 2 and H$\alpha$ lines.},

Here, we report the detection of oscillatory phenomena associated with a large bright-point group that is 430,000 square kilometers in area and located near the solar disk center. Wavelet analysis reveals full-width half-maximum oscillations with periodicities ranging from 126 to 700 seconds originating above the bright point and significance levels exceeding 99{\%}. These oscillations, 2.6 kilometers per second in amplitude, are coupled with chromospheric line-of-sight Doppler velocities with an average blue shift of 23 kilometers per second. A lack of cospatial intensity oscillations and transversal displacements rules out the presence of magneto-acoustic wave modes. The oscillations are a signature of Alfv{\'{e}}n waves produced by a torsional twist of T22 degrees. A phase shift of 180 degrees across the diameter of the bright point suggests that these torsional Alfv{\'{e}}n oscillations are induced globally throughout the entire brightening.

abstract = {Quasi-periodic pulsations (or QPPs) are periodic intensity variations in the flare emission, across all wavelength bands. In this paper, we review the observational and modelling achievements since the previous review on this topic by Nakariakov {\&} Melnikov (2009). In recent years, it has become clear that QPPs are an inherent feature of solar flares, because almost all flares exhibit QPPs. Moreover, it is now firmly established that QPPs often show multiple periods. We also review possible mechanisms for generating QPPs. Up to now, it has not been possible to conclusively identify the triggering mechanism or cause of QPPs. The lack of this identification currently hampers possible seismological inferences of flare plasma parameters. QPPs in stellar flares have been detected for a long time, and the high quality data of the Kepler mission allows to study the QPP more systematically. However, it has not been conclusively shown whether the time scales of stellar QPPs are different or the same as those in solar flares.},

abstract = {We study the three-dimensional magnetic structure of solar active region 11158, which produced one X-class and several M-class flares on 2011 February 13{\$}-{\$}16. We focus on the magnetic twist in four flare events, M6.6, X2.2, M1.0, and M1.1. The magnetic twist is estimated from the nonlinear force-free field extrapolated from the vector fields obtained from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory using magnetohydrodynamic relaxation method developed by $\backslash$cite{\{}2011ApJ...738..161I{\}}. We found that strongly twisted lines ranging from half-turn to one-turn twist were built up just before the M6.6- and X2.2 flares and disappeared after that. Because most of the twist remaining after these flares was less than half-turn twist, this result suggests that the buildup of magnetic twist over the half-turn twist is a key process in the production of large flares. On the other hand, even though these strong twists were also built up just before the M1.0 and M1.1 flares, most of them remained afterwords. Careful topological analysis before the M1.0 and M1.1 flares shows that the strongly twisted lines were surrounded mostly by the weakly twisted lines formed in accordance with the clockwise motion of the positive sunspot, whose footpoints are rooted in strong magnetic flux regions. These results imply that these weakly twisted lines might suppress the activity of the strongly twisted lines in the last two M-class flares.},

abstract = {We present a novel observation of the white-light flare (WLF) continuum, which was significantly enhanced during the X1 flare on March 29, 2014 (SOL2014-03-29T17:48). Data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) in its NUV channel show that at the peak of the continuum enhancement, the contrast at the quasi-continuum window above 2813 $\backslash$AA$\backslash$ reached 100 - 200 {\%} and can be even larger closer to the Mg II lines. This is fully consistent with the hydrogen recombination Balmer continuum emission, which follows an impulsive thermal and non-thermal ionization caused by the precipitation of electron beams through the chromosphere. However, a less probable photospheric continuum enhancement cannot be excluded. The light curves of the Balmer continuum have an impulsive character with a gradual fading, similar to those detected recently in the optical region on Hinode/SOT. This observation represents a first Balmer-continuum detection from space far beyond the Balmer limit (3646 $\backslash$AA), eliminating seeing effects known to complicate the WLF detection. Moreover, we use a spectral window so far unexplored for flare studies, which provides the potential to study the Balmer continuum, as well as many metallic lines appearing in emission during flares. Combined with future ground-based observations of the continuum near the Balmer limit, we will be able to disentangle between various scenarios of the WLF origin. IRIS observations also provide a critical quantitative measure of the energy radiated in the Balmer continuum, which constrains various models of the energy transport and deposition during flares.},

abstract = {The soft X-ray emissions of solar flares come mainly from the bright coronal loops at the highest temperatures normally achieved in the flare process. Their ubiquity has led to their use as a standard measure of flare occurrence and energy, although the overwhelming bulk of the total flare energy goes elsewhere. Recently Dolla et al. (2012) noted quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP) in the soft X-ray signature of the X-class flare SOL2011-02-15, as observed by the standard photometric data from the GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite) spacecraft. In this paper we analyze the suitability of the GOES data for this kind of analysis and find them to be generally valuable after September, 2010 (GOES-15). We then extend the Dolla et al. result to a complete list of X-class flares from Cycle 24, and show that most of them (80{\%}) display QPPs in the impulsive phase. The pulsations show up cleanly in both channels of the GOES data, making use of time-series of irradiance differences (the digital time derivative on the 2-s sampling). We deploy different techniques to characterize the periodicity of GOES pulsations, considering the red-noise properties of the flare signals, finding a range of chracteristic time scales of the QPPs for each event, but usually with no strong signature of a single period dominating in the power spectrum. The QPP may also appear on somewhat longer time scales during the later gradual phase, possibly with a greater tendency towards coherence, but the sampling noise in GOES difference data for large irradiance values (X-class flares) makes these more uncertain. We show that there is minimal phase difference between the differenced GOES energy channels, or between them and the hard X-ray variations on short time scales. During the impulsive phase the footpoints of the newly-forming flare loops may also contribute to the observed soft X-ray variations.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the one-dimensional vertical propagation of linear adiabatic waves in plane atmospheres. In the literature there are various representations of the standard form of the wave equation from which different forms of the so called cut-off frequency are inferred. It is not uncommon that statements concerning the propagation behavior of waves are made which are based on the height dependence of a cut-off frequency. In this paper, first we critically discuss concepts resting on the use of cut-off frequencies. We add a further wave equation to three wave equations previously presented in the literature, yielding an additional cut-off frequency. Comparison among the various cut-off frequencies of the VAL-atmosphere reveals significant differences, which illustrate the difficulties of interpreting a height dependent cut-off frequency. We also discuss the cut-off frequency of the parabolic temperature profile and the behavior of the polytropic atmosphere. The invariants of the four wave equations presented contain first and second derivatives of the adiabatic sound speed. These derivatives cause oscillations and peaks in the space dependent part of the invariants, which unnecessarily complicate the discussion. We therefore present a new form of the wave equation, the invariant of which is extremely simple and does not contain derivatives of the thermodynamic variables. It is valid for any LTE equation of state. It allows us to make effective use of strict oscillation theorems. We calculate the height-dependent part of the invariant of this equation for the VAL-atmosphere including ionization and dissociation. For this real atmosphere, there is no obvious correspondence between the behavior of the invariant and the temperature structure or the sound speed profile. The invariant of the wave equation is nearly constant around the temperature minimum. In the chromosphere, the invariant is almost linear. The case of the wave equation with a linear invariant is studied analytically.},

abstract = {Solar flare precursors depict constrained rate of energy release contrasting the imminent rapid energy release which calls for different regime of plasma processes to be at play. Due to subtle emission during the precursor phase, its diagnostics remain delusive, revealing either the non-thermal electrons (NTEs) or the thermal conduction to be the driver. In this regard, we investigate the chromospheric response during various phases of a B6.4 flare on August 20, 2005. Spatio-temporal investigation of flare ribbon enhancement during the precursor phase, carried out using spectra-images recorded in several wavelength positions on the H-alpha line profile, revealed its delayed response (180 seconds) compared to the X-ray emission, as well as sequential increment in the width of the line-profile which are indicative of a slow heating process. However, energy contained in the H-alpha emission during the precursor phase reach as high as 80{\%} of that estimated during the main phase. Additionally, the plasma hydrodynamics during the precursor phase, as resulted from the application of a single-loop one-dimensional model, revealed the presence of power-law extension in the model generated X-ray spectra, with flux lower than the RHESSI background. Therefore, our multi-wavelength diagnostics and hydrodynamical modeling of the precursor emission indicates the role of a two-stage process. Firstly, reconnection triggered NTEs, although too small in flux to overcome the observational constraints, thermalize in the upper chromosphere. This leads to the generation of a slow conduction front which causes plasma heating during the precursor phase.},

IRIS was launched into a Sun-synchronous orbit on 27 June 2013 using a Pegasus-XL rocket and consists of a 19-cm UV telescope that feeds a slit-based dual-bandpass imaging spectrograph. IRIS obtains spectra in passbands from 1332-1358, 1389-1407 and 2783-2834 Angstrom including bright spectral lines formed in the chromosphere (Mg II h 2803 Angstrom and Mg II k 2796 Angstrom) and transition region (C II 1334/1335 Angstrom and Si IV 1394/1403 Angstrom). Slit-jaw images in four different passbands (C II 1330, Si IV 1400, Mg II k 2796 and Mg II wing 2830 Angstrom) can be taken simultaneously with spectral rasters that sample regions up to 130 arcsec x 175 arcsec at a variety of spatial samplings (from 0.33 arcsec and up). IRIS is sensitive to emission from plasma at temperatures between 5000 K and 10 MK and will advance our understanding of the flow of mass and energy through an interface region, formed by the chromosphere and transition region, between the photosphere and corona. This highly structured and dynamic region not only acts as the conduit of all mass and energy feeding into the corona and solar wind, it also requires an order of magnitude more energy to heat than the corona and solar wind combined. The IRIS investigation includes a strong numerical modeling component based on advanced radiative-MHD codes to facilitate interpretation of observations of this complex region. Approximately eight Gbytes of data (after compression) are acquired by IRIS each day and made available for unrestricted use within a few days of the observation.},

abstract = {We present the first results of sunspot oscillations from observations by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph. The strongly nonlinear oscillation is identified in both the slit-jaw images and the spectra of several emission lines formed in the transition region and chromosphere. We first apply a single Gaussian fit to the profiles of the Mgii 2796.35 {\{}$\backslash$AA{\}}, Cii 1335.71 {\{}$\backslash$AA{\}}, and Si iv 1393.76 {\{}$\backslash$AA{\}} lines in the sunspot. The intensity change is about 30{\%}. The Doppler shift oscillation reveals a sawtooth pattern with an amplitude of about 10 km/s in Si iv. In the umbra the Si iv oscillation lags those of Cii and Mgii by about 3 and 12 s, respectively. The line width suddenly increases as the Doppler shift changes from redshift to blueshift. However, we demonstrate that this increase is caused by the superposition of two emission components. We then perform detailed analysis of the line profiles at a few selected locations on the slit. The temporal evolution of the line core is dominated by the following behavior: a rapid excursion to the blue side, accompanied by an intensity increase, followed by a linear decrease of the velocity to the red side. The maximum intensity slightly lags the maximum blueshift in Si iv, whereas the intensity enhancement slightly precedes the maximum blueshift in Mgii. We find a positive correlation between the maximum velocity and deceleration, a result that is consistent with numerical simulations of upward propagating magnetoacoustic shock waves.},

@article{Noyes1963,
abstract = {From a systematic visual study of sets of "Doppler plates" obtained at the 13-foot spectroheliograph of the Mount Wilson Observatory during 1960 and 1961, the following results were derived: a) Vertical oscillatory motions were found in all medium-strong lines observed. The average period of the motions, about 290 sec, is a well-determined quantity for each spectral line. Slight, but apparently real, variations between the weaker and stronger lines observed suggest that the average period gradually decreases with increasing altitude in the line-forming regions of the upper photosphere. b) An oscillatory fluctuation of residual intensity was found in the cores of the stronger lines observed. The average period is somewhat shorter than that of the velocity oscillations and also exhibits an apparent decrease with increasing altitude. The two oscillations bear a definite phase relation to each other, indicating that they are physically connected. Intensity oscillations were not found in the weaker lines observed or in the core of Ha. These observations are discussed and compared with expectations for a plane wave propagating vertically through an isothermal atmosphere with an altitude-dependent radiative relaxation time.},

@article{Woods2006,
abstract = {The solar X-ray radiation varies more than other wavelengths during flares; thus solar X-ray irradiance measurements are relied upon for detecting flare events as well as used to study flare parameters. There is new information about the spectral and temporal variations of flares using solar irradiance measurements from NASA's Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) and the Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere, Energetics, and Dynamics (TIMED) missions. For one, the improved measurement precision for the total solar irradiance (TSI) measurements by the SORCE Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM) has enabled the first detection of flares in the TSI. These flare observations indicate a total flare energy that is about 105 times more than the X-ray measurements in the 0.1–0.8 nm range. In addition, solar spectral irradiance instruments aboard TIMED and SORCE have observed hundreds of flare events in the 0.1 nm to 190 nm range. These solar ultraviolet measurements show that the ultraviolet irradiance changes during flares account for 50{\%} or more of the flare variations seen in the TSI, with most of the ultraviolet contribution coming from the ultraviolet shortward of 14 nm. The remaining part of the flare energy is assumed to come from the wavelengths longward of 190 nm, typically only needing to be about 100 ppm increase for the largest flares. Another result is that the flare variations in the TSI have a strong limb darkening effect, whereby the flares near the limb indicate variations in the TSI being almost entirely from the ultraviolet shortward of 14 nm.},

The aim is to investigate the existence of propagating waves in the solar chromosphere and the transition region via analyzing the statistical distribution of power in different locations, e.g. in bright magnetic (network), bright non-magnetic and dark non-magnetic (inter-network) regions, separately. We use Fourier power and phase-difference techniques combined with a wavelet analysis. Two-dimensional Fourier power maps were constructed in the period bands 2-4 minutes, 4-6 minutes, 6-15 minutes, and beyond 15 minutes. We detect the presence of long-period oscillations with periods between 15 and 30 minutes in bright magnetic regions. These oscillations were detected from the chromosphere to the transition region. The Fourier power maps show that short-period powers are mainly concentrated in dark regions whereas long-period powers are concentrated in bright magnetic regions. This is the first report of long-period waves in quiet-Sun network regions. We suggest that the observed propagating oscillations are due to magnetoacoustic waves which can be important for the heating of the solar atmosphere.},

abstract = {We aim to study the standing fundamental kink mode of coronal loops in the nonlinear regime, investigating the changes in energy evolution in the cross-section and oscillation amplitude of the loop which are related to nonlinear effects, in particular to the development of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). We run idea, high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations, studying the influence of the initial velocity amplitude and the inhomogeneous layer thickness. We model the coronal loop as a straight, homogeneous magnetic flux tube with an outer inhomogeneous layer, embedded in a straight, homogeneous magnetic field. We find that, for low amplitudes which do not allow for the KHI to develop during the simulated time, the damping time agrees with the theory of resonant absorption. However, for higher amplitudes, the presence of KHI around the oscillating loop can alter the loop's evolution, resulting in a significantly faster damping than predicted by the linear theory in some cases. This questions the accuracy of seismological methods applied to observed damping profiles, based on linear theory.},

This possibility is explored using wave mechanical and ray theory in a model of the Sun's surface layers permeated by uniform inclined magnetic field. It is found that fast-to-slow conversion near the equipartition depth at which the sound and Alfv{\'{e}}n speeds coincide can indeed greatly enhance the atmospheric acoustic signal at heights observed by Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Michelson Doppler Imager and other helioseismic instruments, but that this effect depends crucially on the wave attack angle, i.e. the angle between the wavevector and the magnetic field at the conversion/transmission depth. A major consequence of this insight is that the magnetic field acts as a filter, preferentially allowing through acoustic signal from a narrow range of incident directions. This is potentially testable by observation.},

abstract = {This study aims to quantify characteristic features of the bipolar flux appearance of solar intranetwork (IN) magnetic elements. To attack this problem, we use the Narrowband Filter Imager (NFI) magnetograms from the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on board Hinode; these data are from quiet and enhanced network areas. Cluster emergence of mixed polarities and IN ephemeral regions (ERs) are the most conspicuous forms of bipolar flux appearance within the network. Each of the clusters is characterized by a few well-developed ERs that are partially or fully coaligned in magnetic axis orientation. On average, the sampled IN ERs have a total maximum unsigned flux of several 1017 Mx, a separation of 3 - 4 arcsec, and a lifetime of 10 - 15 minutes. The smallest IN ERs have a maximum unsigned flux of several 1016 Mx, separations of less than 1 arcsec, and lifetimes as short as 5 minutes. Most IN ERs exhibit a rotation of their magnetic axis of more than 10 degrees during flux emergence. Peculiar flux appearance, e.g., bipole shrinkage followed by growth or the reverse, is not unusual. A few examples show repeated shrinkage-growth or growth-shrinkage, like magnetic floats in the dynamic photosphere. The observed bipolar behavior seems to carry rich information on magnetoconvection in the subphotospheric layer.},

abstract = {This analysis begins to explore the complex chromosphere-corona mass cycle using a blend of imaging and spectroscopic diagnostics. Single Gaussian fits to hot emission line profiles (formed above 1MK) at the base of coronal loop structures indicate material blue-shifts of 5-10km/s while cool emission line profiles (formed below 1MK) yield red-shifts of a similar magnitude - indicating, to zeroth order, that a temperature-dependent bifurcating flow exists on coronal structures. Image sequences of the same region reveal weakly emitting upward propagating disturbances in both hot and cool emission with apparent speeds of 50-150km/s. Spectroscopic observations indicate that these propagating disturbances produce a weak emission component in the blue wing at commensurate speed, but that they contribute only a few percent to the (ensemble) emission line profile in a single spatio-temporal resolution element. Subsequent analysis of imaging data shows material "draining" slowly ({\~{}}10km/s) out of the corona, but only in the cooler passbands. We interpret the draining as the return-flow of coronal material at the end of the complex chromosphere-corona mass cycle. Further, we suggest that the efficient radiative cooling of the draining material produces a significant contribution to the red wing of cool emission lines that is ultimately responsible for their systematic red-shift as derived from a single Gaussian fit when compared to those formed in hotter (conductively dominated) domains. The presence of counter-streaming flows complicates the line profiles, their interpretation, and asymmetry diagnoses, but allows a different physical picture of the lower corona to develop.},

abstract = {Solar EUV irradiance plays a critical role in the variability of the upper atmosphere and ionosphere of Earth. Many systems are impacted by these terrestrial changes including radio communication, GPS navigation, and satellite orbits. Monitoring the solar EUV irradiance in the past has been left to research satellites and there have been long periods where gaps in the observational record make it difficult to study and understand the long-term trends and impacts on Earth. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has, for the first time, included an EUV Sensor (EUVS) on the Geostationary Environmental Operational Satellite (GOES). This EUV Sensor (EUVS), launched in May 2006, is design to provide the solar EUV irradiance information most critical to understanding and modeling Earth's upper atmosphere. The EUVS has five broad EUV channels between 5 and 125 nm. It uses transmission gratings and thin-film filters for wavelength discrimination and silicon diodes for detectors. The EUVS was extensively calibrated at the Brookhaven National Labs Synchrotron Light Source with calibration standards traceable to NIST. It samples the solar irradiance every ten seconds on a continuous basis from geosynchronous orbit. This paper will provide an overview of the EUVS design, calibration, and performance results.},

abstract = {The solar disk is a bright source of multi-GeV gamma rays, due to the interactions of hadronic cosmic rays with the solar atmosphere. However, the underlying production mechanism is not understood, except that its efficiency must be greatly enhanced by magnetic fields that redirect some cosmic rays from ingoing to outgoing before they interact. To elucidate the nature of this emission, we perform a new analysis of solar atmospheric gamma rays with 9 years of Fermi-LAT data, which spans nearly the full 11-year solar cycle. We detect significant gamma-ray emission from the solar disk from 1 GeV up to 200 GeV. The overall gamma-ray spectrum is much harder (∼ E −2.2 $\gamma$) than the cosmic-ray spectrum (∼ E −2.7 CR). We find a clear anticorrelation between the solar cycle phase and the gamma-ray flux between 1–10 GeV. Surprisingly, we observe a spectral dip between ∼30–50 GeV in an otherwise power-law spectrum. This was not predicted, is not understood, and may provide crucial clues to the gamma-ray emission mechanism. The flux above 100 GeV, which is brightest during the solar minimum, poses exciting opportunities for HAWC, LHAASO, IceCube, and KM3NeT.},

@article{Chae2015,
abstract = {Even though it is well-known from observations of the Sun that three-minute period chromospheric oscillations persist in the internetwork quiet regions and sunspot umbrae, until now their origin and persistence has defied clear explanation. Here we provide a clear and simple explanation for it with a demonstration of how such oscillations at the chromosphereʼs cutoff frequency naturally arise in a gravitationally stratified medium when it is disturbed. The largest-wavenumber vertical components of a chromospheric disturbance produce the highest-frequency wave packets, which propagate out of the disturbed region at group speeds that are close to the sound speed. Meanwhile, the smallest-wavenumber components develop into wave packets of frequencies close to the acoustic cutoff frequency that propagate at group speeds that are much lower than the sound speed. Because of their low propagation speed, these low-frequency wave packets linger in the disturbed region and nearby, and thus, are the ones that an observer would identify as the persistent, chromospheric three-minute oscillations. We emphasize that we can account for the power of the persistent chromospheric oscillations as coming from the repeated occurrence of disturbances with length scales greater than twice the pressure scale height in the upper photosphere.},

The HMI instrument is part of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) that was launched on 11 February 2010. The instrument is designed to measure the Doppler shift, intensity, and vector magnetic field at the solar photosphere using the 6173 {\AA} Fe uc(i) absorption line. The instrument consists of a front-window filter, a telescope, a set of waveplates for polarimetry, an image-stabilization system, a blocking filter, a five-stage Lyot filter with one tunable element, two wide-field tunable Michelson interferometers, a pair of 40962 pixel cameras with independent shutters, and associated electronics. Each camera takes a full-disk image roughly every 3.75 seconds giving an overall cadence of 45 seconds for the Doppler, intensity, and line-of-sight magnetic-field measurements and a slower cadence for the full vector magnetic field. This article describes the design of the HMI instrument and provides an overview of the pre-launch calibration efforts.

abstract = {This paper develops the zero-dimensional (0D) hydrodynamic coronal loop model "Enthalpy-based Thermal Evolution of Loops" (EBTEL) proposed by Klimchuk et al., which studies the plasma response to evolving coronal heating, especially impulsive heating events. The basis of EBTEL is the modeling of mass exchange between the corona and transition region (TR) and chromosphere in response to heating variations, with the key parameter being the ratio of the TR to coronal radiation. We develop new models for this parameter that now include gravitational stratification and a physically motivated approach to radiative cooling. A number of examples are presented, including nanoflares in short and long loops, and a small flare. The new features in EBTEL are important for accurate tracking of, in particular, the density. The 0D results are compared to a 1D hydro code (Hydrad) with generally good agreement. EBTEL is suitable for general use as a tool for (1) quick-look results of loop evolution in response to a given heating function, (2) extensive parameter surveys, and (3) situations where the modeling of hundreds or thousands of elemental loops is needed. A single run takes a few seconds on a contemporary laptop.},

abstract = {We explore the quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) with multiple periods in hard X-ray (HXR) emission from Fermi/GBM during the impulsive phase of solar flare (SOL2014-09-10). The completely new observational result is that the shorter periods appear at lower energies of the X-ray photons at the beginning and the longer periods appear at higher energies at the end, with some intersection of the periods at medium energies. We also find the shorter and then the longer periods during the same phase of this flare. Using the wavelet power spectrum and fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectrum, we analyze the normalized rapidly varying signal divided by its slowly varying signal, which is the smoothed original HXR flux. The periods of 27 s and 37 s are derived at lower energy channels between 17:25 UT and 17:29 UT, i.e., 12.0-27.3 keV and 27.3-50.9 keV. Then the periods of 27 s, 46 s and 60 s are observed at medium-energy channel from 17:26 UT to 17:33 UT, such as 50.9-102.3 keV. And the period of 80 s is detected at higher energy channel from 17:28 UT to 17:33 UT, such as 102.3-296.4 keV.},

abstract = {Waves observed in the photosphere and chromosphere of sunspots show complex dynamics and spatial patterns. The interpretation of high-resolution sunspot wave observations requires modeling of three-dimensional (3D) nonlinear wave propagation and mode transformation in the sunspot upper layers in realistic spot model atmospheres. Here, we present the first results of such modeling. We have developed a 3D nonlinear numerical code specially designed to calculate the response of magnetic structures in equilibrium to an arbitrary perturbation. The code solves the 3D nonlinear MHD equations for perturbations; it is stabilized by hyper-diffusivity terms and is fully parallelized. The robustness of the code is demonstrated by a number of standard tests. We analyze several simulations of a sunspot perturbed by pulses of different periods at a subphotospheric level, from short periods, introduced for academic purposes, to longer and realistic periods of 3 and 5 minutes. We present a detailed description of the 3D mode transformation in a non-trivial sunspot-like magnetic field configuration, including the conversion between fast and slow magneto-acoustic waves and the Alfv{\'{e}}n wave, by calculation of the wave energy fluxes. Our main findings are as follows: (1) the conversion from acoustic to the Alfv{\'{e}}n mode is only observed if the driving pulse is located out of the sunspot axis, but this conversion is energetically inefficient; (2) as a consequence of the cutoff effects and refraction of the fast magneto-acoustic mode, the energy of the evanescent waves with periods around 5 minutes remains almost completely below the level $\beta$ = 1; (3) waves with frequencies above the cutoff propagate field aligned to the chromosphere and their power becomes dominating over that of evanescent 5 minute oscillations, in agreement with observations.},

These new observations make possible a unified description of both phenomena. Coronal rain and periodic intensity pulsations of loops are two manifestations of the same physical process: evaporation / condensation cycles resulting from a state of thermal nonequilibrium (TNE). The fluctuations around coronal temperatures produce the intensity pulsations of loops, and rain falls along their legs if thermal runaway cools the periodic condensations down and below transition-region (TR) temperatures. This scenario is in line with the predictions of numerical models of quasi-steadily and footpoint heated loops. The presence of coronal rain -- albeit non-periodic -- in several other structures within the studied field of view implies that this type of heating is at play on a large scale.},

abstract = {elocity fields in the solar atmosphere have been detected and measured by an adaptation of a technique previously used for measuring magnetic fields Data obtained during the summers of 1960 and 1961 have been partially analyzed and yield the following principal results: 1. Large "cells" of horizontally moving material are distributed roughly uniformly over the entire solar surface. The motions within each cell suggest a (horizontal) outward flow from a source inside the cell. Typical diameters are 1.6 X 10 km; spacings between centers, 3 X 10 km ( 5 X 10 cells over the solar surface); r.m S. velocities of outflow, 0.5 km sec-1 lifetimes, sec. There is a similarity in appearance to the Ca+ network. The appearance and properties of these cells suggest that they are a surface manifestation of a "supergranulation" pattern of convective currents which come from relatively great depths inside the sun. 2. A distinct correlation is observed between local brightness fluctuations and vertical velocities: bright elements tend to move upward, at the levels at which the lines Fe X 6102 and Ca X 6103 are formed. In the line Ca X 6103, the correlation coefficient is 0.5. This correlation appears to reverse in sign in the height range spanned by the Doppler wings of the Na D1 line and remains reversed at levels up to that of Ca+ X 8542. At the level of Ca X 6103, an estimate of the mechanical energy transport yields the rather large value 2 W cm . 3. The characteristic "cell size" of the vertical velocities appears to increase with height from 1700 km at the level of Fe X 6102 to 3500 km at that of Na X 5896. The r.m s. vertical velocity of 0 4 km appears nearly constant over this height range. 4. The vertical velocities exhibit a striking repetitive time correlation, with a period T = 296 * 3 sec. This quasi-sinusoidal motion has been followed for three full periods in the line Ca 6103, and is also clearly present in Fe X 6102, Na X 5896, and other lines. The energy contained in this oscillatory motion is about 160 J cm the "losses" can apparently be compensated for by the energy transport (2). 5. A similar repetitive time correlation, with nearly the same period, seems to be present in the brightness {\{} observed on ordinary spectroheliograms taken at the center of the Na D1 line. We believe that we are observing the transformation of potential energy into wave energy through the brightness-velocity correlation in the photosphere, the upward propagation of this energy by waves of rather well-defined frequency, and its dissipation into heat in the lower chromosphere. 6. Doppler velocities have been observed at various heights in the upper chromosphere by means of the Ha line. At great heights one finds a granular structure with a mean size of about 3600 km, but at lower levels one finds predominantly downward motions, which are concentrated in "tunnels" which presumably follow magnetic lines of force and are geometrically related to the Ca+ network. The Doppler field changes its appearance very y at higher levels, typical lifetimes being about 30 seconds.}},

abstract = {A wide variety of phenomena such as gentle but persistent brightening, dynamic slender features ({\~{}}100 km), and compact ({\~{}}1'') ultraviolet (UV) bursts are associated with the heating of the solar chromosphere. High spatio-temporal resolution is required to capture the finer details of the likely magnetic reconnection-driven, rapidly evolving bursts. Such observations are also needed to reveal their similarities to large-scale flares, which are also thought to be reconnection driven, and more generally their role in chromospheric heating. Here we report observations of chromospheric heating in the form of a UV burst obtained with the balloon-borne observatory, SUNRISE. The observed burst displayed a spatial morphology similar to that of a large-scale solar flare with circular ribbon. While the co-temporal UV observations at 1.5'' spatial resolution and 24s cadence from the Solar Dynamics Observatory showed a compact brightening, the SUNRISE observations at diffraction-limited spatial resolution of 0.1'' at 7s cadence revealed a dynamic sub-structure of the burst that it is composed of extended ribbon-like features and a rapidly evolving arcade of thin ({\~{}}0.1'' wide) magnetic loop-like features, similar to post-flare loops. Such a dynamic sub-structure reveals the small-scale nature of chromospheric heating in these bursts. Furthermore, based on magnetic field extrapolations, this heating event is associated with a complex fan-spine magnetic topology. Our observations strongly hint at a unified picture of magnetic heating in the solar atmosphere from some large-scale flares to small-scale bursts, all being associated with such a magnetic topology.},

@article{Stangalini2011,
abstract = {MHD wave propagation inside the Sun's atmosphere is closely related to the magnetic field topology. For example, magnetic fields are able to lower the cutoff frequency for acoustic waves thus allowing waves which would otherwise be trapped below the photosphere to propagate into the upper atmosphere. Another example is that MHD waves can be transmitted or converted into other forms of waves at altitudes where the sound speed equals the Alfv$\backslash$'en speed. We take advantage of the large field-of-view provided by the IBIS experiment to study the wave propagation at two heights in the solar atmosphere, as sampled by the photospheric Fe 617.3 nm spectral line and the chromospheric Ca 854.2 nm spectral line, and its relationship to the local magnetic field. Among other things, we find substantial leakage of waves with 5-minute periods in the chromosphere at the edges of a pore and in the diffused magnetic field surrounding it. By using spectro-polarimetric inversions of Hinode SOT/SP data, we also find a relationship between the photospheric power spectrum and the magnetic field inclination angle; in particular, well-defined transmission peaks around 25$\backslash$degree for 5 minutes waves and around 15$\backslash$degree for 3 minutes waves. We propose a very simple model based upon wave transmission theory to explain this behavior. Finally, an analysis of both the power spectra and chromospheric amplification spectra suggests the presence of longitudinal acoustic waves along the magnetic field lines.},

@article{Wiegelmann2012,
abstract = {The structure and dynamics of the solar corona is dominated by the magnetic field. In most areas in the corona magnetic forces are so dominant that all non-magnetic forces like plasma pressure gradient and gravity can be neglected in the lowest order. This model assumption is called the force-free field assumption, as the Lorentz force vanishes. This can be obtained by either vanishing electric currents (leading to potential fields) or the currents are co-aligned with the magnetic field lines. First we discuss a mathematically simpler approach that the magnetic field and currents are proportional with one global constant, the so-called linear force-free field approximation. In the generic case, however, the relation between magnetic fields and electric currents is nonlinear and analytic solutions have been only found for special cases, like 1D or 2D configurations. For constructing realistic nonlinear force-free coronal magnetic field models in 3D, sophisticated numerical computations are required and boundary conditions must be obtained from measurements of the magnetic field vector in the solar photosphere. This approach is currently of large interests, as accurate measurements of the photospheric field become available from ground-based (for example SOLIS) and space-born (for example Hinode and SDO) instruments. If we can obtain accurate force-free coronal magnetic field models we can calculate the free magnetic energy in the corona, a quantity which is important for the prediction of flares and coronal mass ejections. Knowledge of the 3D structure of magnetic field lines also help us to interpret other coronal observations, e.g., EUV-images of the radiating coronal plasma.},

abstract = {The asymmetries observed in the line profiles of solar flares can provide important diagnostics of the properties and dynamics of the flaring atmosphere. In this paper the evolution of the Halpha and Ca II 8542 {\{}$\backslash$AA{\}} lines are studied using high spatial, temporal and spectral resolution ground-based observations of an M1.1 flare obtained with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. The temporal evolution of the Halpha line profiles from the flare kernel shows excess emission in the red wing (red asymmetry) before flare maximum, and excess in the blue wing (blue asymmetry) after maximum. However, the Ca II 8542 {\{}$\backslash$AA{\}} line does not follow the same pattern, showing only a weak red asymmetry during the flare. RADYN simulations are used to synthesise spectral line profiles for the flaring atmosphere, and good agreement is found with the observations. We show that the red asymmetry observed in Halpha is not necessarily associated with plasma downflows, and the blue asymmetry may not be related to plasma upflows. Indeed, we conclude that the steep velocity gradients in the flaring chromosphere modifies the wavelength of the central reversal in the Halpha line profile. The shift in the wavelength of maximum opacity to shorter and longer wavelengths generates the red and blue asymmetries, respectively.},

In previous works we have shown that high-frequency waves are generated in such a magnetic configuration. This paper studies those waves in detail in order to provide a plausible explanation of their generation. We demonstrate that slow magneto-acoustic shock waves generated in the chromosphere propagate through the null point and produce a train of secondary shocks that escape along the field lines. A particular combination of the shock wave speeds generates waves at a frequency of 80 mHz. We speculate that this frequency may be sensitive to the atmospheric parameters in the corona and therefore can be used to probe the structure of this solar layer.},

abstract = {Observations of the upper chromosphere shows an enormous amount of intricate fine structure. Much of this comes in the form of linear features which are most often assumed to be well aligned with the direction of the magnetic field in the low plasma beta regime thought to dominate the upper chromosphere. We use advanced radiative MHD simulations including the effects of ion-neutral interactions (using the generalized Ohm's law) in the partially ionized chromosphere to show that the magnetic field is often not well aligned with chromospheric features. This occurs where the ambipolar diffusion is large, i.e., ions and neutral populations decouple as the ion-neutral collision frequency drops allowing the field to slip through the neutral population, currents perpendicular to the field are strong, and thermodynamic timescales are longer than or similar to the those of ambipolar diffusion. We find this often happens in dynamic spicule or fibril-like features at the top of the chromosphere. This has important consequences for field extrapolation methods which increasingly use such upper chromospheric features to help constrain the chromospheric magnetic field: our results invalidate the underlying assumption that these features are aligned with the field. In addition, our results cast doubt on results from 1D hydrodynamic models, which assume that plasma remains on the same field lines. Finally, our simulations show that ambipolar diffusion significantly alters the amount of free energy available in the coronal part of our simulated volume, which is likely to have consequences for studies of flare initiation.},

abstract = {Oscillations in network bright points (NBPs) are studied at a variety of chromospheric heights. In particular, the three-dimensional variation of NBP oscillations is studied using image segmentation and cross-correlation analysis between images taken in light of Ca II K-3, Halpha core, Mg I b(2), and Mg I b(1) - 0.4 Angstrom. Wavelet analysis is used to isolate wave packets in time and to search for height-dependent time delays that result from upward- or downward-directed traveling waves. In each NBP studied, we find evidence for kink-mode waves (1.3, 1.9 mHz), traveling up through the chromosphere and coupling with sausage-mode waves (2.6, 3.8 mHz). This provides a means for depositing energy in the upper chromosphere. We also find evidence for other upward- and downward-propagating waves in the 1.3-4.6 mHz range. Some oscillations do not correspond to traveling waves, and we attribute these to waves generated in neighboring regions.},

abstract = {We study the response of the solar atmosphere to excitations with adiabatic large amplitude acoustic waves. Both monochromatic waves and acoustic spectra are considered. For monochromatic excitation a critical frequency $\nu${\_}cr{\_} is found which separates different domains of resonance behaviour. Upon excitation with frequencies $\nu${\textless}$\nu${\_}cr{\_} the atmospheric resonance decays rapidly with time as in the small amplitude wave case, while for $\nu${\textgreater}$\nu${\_}cr{\_}, persistent resonance oscillations occur which are caused by shock overtakings. Excitation by acoustic spectra always leads to the $\nu${\textgreater}$\nu${\_}cr{\_} behaviour. Independent of the spectral shape and energy, acoustic spectra generate oscillations mainly at frequencies $\nu$=6-7mHz at the top of the chromosphere. The photospheric 5-min oscillation does not influence our chromospheric results. Shock heating by acoustic spectra is roughly similar to that of a monochromatic wave of period 35s. Irrespective of the initial spectral shape and energy and even of the gravity and effective temperature of the star, a universal average shock strength M{\_}S{\_}=1.5 is found. Due to our adiabatic treatment, the atmospheric slabs suffer extension which grows with wave energy.},

@article{Pascoe2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} ESO, 2016.Aims. Strongly damped standing and propagating kink oscillations are observed in the solar corona. This can be understood in terms of mode coupling, which causes the wave energy to be converted from the bulk transverse oscillation to localised, unresolved azimuthal motions. The damping rate can provide information about the loop structure, and theory predicts two possible damping profiles. Methods. We used the recently compiled catalogue of decaying standing kink oscillations of coronal loops to search for examples with high spatial and temporal resolution and sufficient signal quality to allow the damping profile to be examined. The location of the loop axis was tracked, detrended, and fitted with sinusoidal oscillations with Gaussian and exponential damping profiles. Results. Using the highest quality data currently available, we find that for the majority of our cases a Gaussian profile describes the damping behaviour at least as well as an exponential profile, which is consistent with the recently developed theory for the damping profile due to mode coupling.},

It is the source of the bulk of a flare's radiant energy - in particular the visible/UV continuum radiation. It also provides tracers that guide us to the coronal source of the energy, even though we do not yet understand the propagation of the energy from its storage in the corona to its release in the chromosphere.

We simulate two dimensional magnetic reconnection in a Harris current sheet with a numerical model which includes ion-neutral scattering collisions, ionization, recombination, optically thin radiative loss, collisional heating, and thermal conduction. In the resulting tearing mode reconnection the neutral and ion fluids become decoupled upstream from the reconnection site, creating an excess of ions in the reconnection region and therefore an ionization imbalance. Ion recombination in the reconnection region, combined with Alfv$\backslash$'{\{}e{\}}nic outflows, quickly removes ions from the reconnection site, leading to a fast reconnection rate independent of Lundquist number. In addition to allowing fast reconnection, we find that these non-equilibria partial ionization effects lead to the onset of the nonlinear secondary tearing instability at lower values of the Lundquist number than has been found in fully ionized plasmas.These simulations provide evidence that magnetic reconnection in the chromosphere could be responsible for jet-like transient phenomena such as spicules and chromospheric jets.},

@article{Kneer1983,
abstract = {The authors have performed a power analysis of time sequences of photographic K and H$\alpha$ filtergrams from disc center of the sun. The results are: In the k-$\omega$-diagram from the Ca II K filtergrams, the modal structure of the 5-min-oscillation is clearly seen. The 5-min modes are difficult to detect in the k-$\omega$-diagrams from the H$\alpha$ sequences. In both lines, K and H$\alpha$, the authors observe ridges in the k-$\omega$-diagrams running parallel to the kh-axis. Their periods correspond to the chromospheric 3-min-oscillation. But power appears also, in discrete ridges, at shorter periods P = 60 s...150 s, where the lower limit is given by the Nyquist frequency of the observations. After subtraction of the time averaged intensity at each position in the filtergrams, the rms fluctuations are 3.5{\%} in K and 4.0{\%} in H$\alpha$.},

@article{Machado1986,
abstract = {The authors reexamine the role of the negative hydrogen ion, H-, in the energy balance of the deep solar chromosphere and find, in contrast with earlier authors, that H- is a source of heating in these levels. The response of this region to an ionizing flux of flare-associated UV radiation (1500 ⪉ $\lambda$ ⪉ 1900 {\AA}) is then addressed: the authors find that the excess ionization of Si to Si+ increases the local electron number density considerably, since most species are largely neutral at deep chromospheric levels. This in turn increases the electron-hydrogen atom association rate, the H- abundance, and the rate of absorption of photospheric radiation by this ion. The authors find that the excess absorption by this process may lead to a substantial temperature enhancement at temperature minimum levels during flares.},

abstract = {Oscillation properties in two sunspots and two facular regions are studied using Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) data and ground-based observations in the SiI 10827 and HeI 10830 lines. The aim is to study different-frequency spatial distribution characteristics above sunspots and faculae and their dependence on magnetic-field features and to detect the oscillations that reach the corona from the deep photosphere most effectively. We used Fast-Fourier-Transform and frequency filtration of the intensity and Doppler-velocity variations with Morlet wavelet to trace the wave propagating from the photosphere to the chromosphere and corona. Spatial distribution of low-frequency (1-2 mHz) oscillations outlines well the fan-loop structures in the corona (the Fe IX 171 line) above sunspots and faculae. High-frequency oscillations (5-7 mHz) are concentrated in fragments inside the photospheric umbra boundaries and close to facular-region centers. This implies that the upper parts of most coronal loops, which transfer low-frequency oscillations from the photosphere, sit in the Fe IX 171 line-formation layer. We used dominant frequency vs. distance from barycenter relations to estimate magnetic-tube inclination angle in the higher layers, which poses difficulties for direct magnetic-field measurements. According to our calculations, this angle is about 40 degrees in the transition region around umbra borders. Phase velocities measured in the coronal loops' upper parts in the Fe IX 171 line-formation layer reach 100-150 km/s for sunspots and 50-100 km/s for faculae.},

abstract = {We present imaging and spectroscopic observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph of the evolution of the flare ribbon in the SOL2014-04-18T13:03 M-class flare event, at high spatial resolution and time cadence. These observations reveal small-scale substructure within the ribbon, which manifests as coherent quasi-periodic oscillations in both position and Doppler velocities. We consider various alternative explanations for these oscillations, including modulation of chromospheric evaporation flows. Among these, we find the best support for some form of wave localized to the coronal current sheet, such as a tearing mode or Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.},

abstract = {We present multi-wavelength observations of an M-class flare (M3.9) that occurred on 2014 June 11. Our observations were conducted with the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST), adaptive optics, the multi-camera system ROSA (Rapid Oscillations in Solar Atmosphere) and new HARDcam (Hydrogen-Alpha Rapid Dynamics) camera in various wavelengths, such as Ca II K, Mg I b{\$}{\_}2{\$} (at 5172.7 $\backslash$AA), and H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} narrow-band, and G-band continuum filters.

We observed intensity increases of {\$}\backslashapprox{\$}120-150$\backslash${\%} in the Mg, Ca K and H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} narrow band filters during the flare. Intensity increases for the flare observed in the SDO EUV channels were several times larger, and the GOES X-rays increased over a factor of 30 for the harder band. Only a modest delay is found between the onset of flare ribbons of a nearby sympathetic flare and the main flare ribbons observed in these narrow-band filters. The peak flare emission occurs within a few seconds for the Ca K, Mg, and H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} bands. Time-distance techniques find propagation velocities of {\$}\backslashapprox{\$}60 km/s and as high as 300 km/s for regions of the main flare ribbon. This result and delays and velocities observed with SDO ({\$}\backslashapprox{\$}100 km/s) for different coronal heights agree well with the simple model of energy propagation versus height, although a more detailed model for the flaring solar atmosphere is needed. Future high time resolution observations of solar flares (such as those available with DKIST) are important for disentangling the detailed flare-physics.},
