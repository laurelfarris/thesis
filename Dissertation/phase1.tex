        curve is the power from flux after applying an FFT high-pass filter

        such as the global flare curve, which dominates the spectrum at
        low frequencies.

        integrated emission from NOAA AR 11158 in discrete time increments of
        64 frames ($\sim$25.6 minutes) each. The dashed horizontal line marks the
        central frequency $\nu_{c}$ at $\sim$5.6 mHz, corresponding to a period
        of 3 minutes. The dotted horizontal lines on either side of $\nu_{c}$
        mark the edges of the frequency bandpass $\Delta\nu$ = 1 mHz. The
        vertical lines mark the flare, start, peak, and end times as determined
        by \textit{GOES}. The power is scaled logarithmically and over the same
        range in both channels.
        Note that the x-axis labels do not necessarily line up with the
        boundaries of the data columns.
