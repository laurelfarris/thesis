\subsection{Damping behavior of 3-minute oscillations}

3mOs are interpreted as slow, propagating magnetoacoustic waves,
which have a characteristic excitation mechanism and damping rate,
depending on the local plasma conditions where they originate.

The timescales over which the oscillatory power is expected to change
depends on the nature of the oscillations themselves.
