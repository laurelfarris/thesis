\section{Normalization of Power Spectrum}

Figure~\ref{norm_vs_not} shows power spectra for each AIA channel
during the X-class flare and during the pre-flare period.
These were calculated with and without normalizing to see which
method was best for the type of analysis utilized in this work.

    \caption{Fourier power spectrum for quiet vs. flaring times,
    comparing calculations without normalizing (left panels) to
    those with normalizing (right panels) for both AIA 1600\AA{}
    (top) and AIA 1700\AA{} (bottom).
    All spectra were obtained by applying a Fourier transform
    to the integrated emission from AR 11158.
