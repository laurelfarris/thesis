Codes in this directory I did NOT write:
  • horline.pro
  • verline.pro
  • pickpeakpower.pro
  • randomwave.pro
  • sdbwave.pro
    NOTE: sdbwave2.pro is a copy of the original, where I commented out
      most of the lines creating graphics, and rewrote them to call IDL's functions
      and create objects, e.g.: >plt = PLOT(x, y, ...) instead of >PLOT, x, y, ...


Codes I DID write:
  • filter.pro
  • my_wavelet.pro (calls sdbwave)
  • wa.pro
  • wa2.pro
