  --> README file for wavelet analysis codes

NOTE: I did not write most of the codes in this directory


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mine:
  • wa.pro & wa2.pro
     (technically not even wavelet analysis... compute a "windowed Fourier transform")
  • filter.pro
    ° current, updated version
  • filter_OLD_20200515.pro
    ° old version, copied to preserve potentially useful code, comments, and date
  • my_wavelet.pro (calls sdbwave)
  • sdbwave2.pro (calls sdbwave)
        NOTE:
          Not really mine: made copy of sdbwave.pro and modified slightly to
          replace graphic procedures with functions to return objects, e.g.:
              plt = PLOT(x, y, ...)
          in place of procedures:
              PLOT, x, y, ...


NOT mine:
  • horline.pro
  • verline.pro
  • pickpeakpower.pro
  • randomwave.pro
  • sdbwave.pro
  • shuffle.pro
      Moved here from top code directory since the only routine that calls it
      is randomwave.pro. Not sure why I didn't put it here to begin with.
