How to organize codes?

Directories for "imaging" and "plotting" don't really work because those
are used for everything. Put general codes in Graphics/

Grouping by type of figure, e.g. "Lightcurves", "Maps", etc.
gets complicated when they use a lot of the same base routines
(like plotting something as function of time)
or when want to produce each type of figure for the same subregion
(which also has its own directory).

Moved everything in "Quiet/" to "Subregions/", since quiet subregions
are a subset of subregions...

Subregions/ vs. Maps/...
WHAT I'm looking at vs. analysis methods used... subregions could have
powermaps, light curves, contours, all the things that are split into
different directories.

What codes do I tend to use together?
That's probably the best way to organize them.

Should have general routines that are specific to this project
(unlike plot2, image3, etc.) that can take an array of z_start values,
or a subset of data in x/y.
