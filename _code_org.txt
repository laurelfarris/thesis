Top dir: develop codes, short names,

move "modules" (any well-developed code that gets called often, but rarely
needs to be edited) to some directory to keep work somewhat clutter-free.

Need quick ref. of routine name, what it does, and calling syntax.

Other/ and Modules/ seem to be used interchangably as codes that don't
  really go in the other categorized directories.

"Pre-analysis" routines
    aia_prep
    alignment


WA routines fall under both power spectra and power "curves"


Imaging -- difficulties with imaging power maps and intensity "maps" in the
same loop and/or same structure -- either create two entirely different
figures and read into latex side by side,
or create two separate loops.
 Extra loop may take up more space, but code written like that may be much
 easier to understand and USE later when I need them!

How to organize codes?

Directories for "imaging" and "plotting" don't really work because those
are used for everything. Put general codes in Graphics/

Grouping by type of figure, e.g. "Lightcurves", "Maps", etc.
gets complicated when they use a lot of the same base routines
(like plotting something as function of time)
or when want to produce each type of figure for the same subregion
(which also has its own directory).

Moved everything in "Quiet/" to "Subregions/", since quiet subregions
are a subset of subregions...

Subregions/ vs. Maps/...
WHAT I'm looking at vs. analysis methods used... subregions could have
powermaps, light curves, contours, all the things that are split into
different directories.

What codes do I tend to use together?
That's probably the best way to organize them.

Should have general routines that are specific to this project
(unlike plot2, image3, etc.) that can take an array of z_start values,
or a subset of data in x/y.
