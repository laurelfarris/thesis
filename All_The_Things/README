Should be generating every single figure I can think of.

This directory is specifically for this purpose,
without making a mess in my working directory.

Examples of things to try:

    * lightcurves
        - absolute values
        - normalized between 0 and 1
        - mean-subtracted

    * several values of
        - time segment length (dz/dT)
        - frequency bandpass (\Delta\nu)
        - central frequency (\nu_{c})

    * Fourier power spectra

    * start/stop times of time segments (regardless of dz value);
        - time of flare peak separating two successive time segments
        - segment containing entire flare, compared to completely before and after


    * Power as function of time P(t)
        - several values of dz, d\nu, central frequency

    * P(t) overplotted with running average lc (over same dz used to calc P(t)).


    * Power maps
        - HMI data
        - Normalize power by variance of input signal
        - Normalize power between 0 and 1

    * Subregions
        - single pixel in umbra, penumbra, and quiet sun
        - integrated emission over entire umbra, penumbra, and quiet sun
            (need to define the boundary between them).
