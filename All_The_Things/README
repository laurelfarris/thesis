Generate every single figure you can think of.
Or at least create a new .pro file set up to do so, even if just a few comments.
Best place to keep track of coding I want to do, becaue this is where I do the coding!

This directory is specifically for this purpose,
without making a mess in my working directory.

New .pro file and comments describing ideas for figures.

Examples of things to try:




    * lightcurves
        - absolute values
        - normalized between 0 and 1
        - mean-subtracted

    * several values of
        - time segment length (dz/dT)
        - frequency bandpass (\Delta\nu)
        - central frequency (\nu_{c})

    * Fourier power spectra: P(\nu)
        - power vs. frequency
        - alog10(power) vs. frequency
        - power normalized between 0 and 1
            (Can't see much of anything if plot power as is,
            but taking log makes it look like the 3-minute
            signal doesn't stand out much at all...
            though maybe it just doesn't)


    * start/stop times of time segments (regardless of dz value);
        - time of flare peak separating two successive time segments
        - segment containing entire flare, compared to completely before and after

    * Power as function of time: P(t)
        - several values of dz, d\nu, central frequency
           (from integrated flux... maps take too long to compute)

    * P(t) overplotted with running average lc (over same dz used to calc P(t)).


    * Power maps
        - HMI data
        - Normalize power by variance of input signal
        - Normalize power between 0 and 1
        - Compare different channels (same time segment)
        - Compare different central frequencies (3min, 5min, etc.)

    * Subregions
        - single pixel in umbra, penumbra, and quiet sun
        - integrated emission over entire umbra, penumbra, and quiet sun
            (need to define the boundary between them).
