Codes/Lightcurves/
    contains IDL procedures for plotting flare lightcurves
      -> for general plotting routines, see Codes/Graphics/



19 November 2024 --
   Updated _README with (several) files in directory not even mentioned here ...


2021 January 13 --
  moved "plot_aia_lc.pro" here from main working dir (one level up).
  Uses plotting procedures and routines from SDO guide examples.
2021 July 07 --
  renamed to "plot_lc_SDO-GUIDE.pro" ??


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General routine(s) for plotting light curves:
  ★ plot_lc.pro
  • plot_lightcurve_reference.pro
     -> used as reference while doing research (not for publications or presentations)
  • plot_lc_GENERAL.pro
  • plot_lc_20210707.pro
     copied plot_lc.pro on 07 July 2021 to preserve extra ML code
      (poss. relevant to Alignment procedures and flux computation,
           according to comments)

BDA:
  • bda_lightcurves.pro
  • plot_bda_lightcurves.pro



Axis labels:
  • label_time.pro
      -> Last modified 17 November 2018 !!
         [] Needs improvements in comments & documentation
              (at some point)


Shift plots in y-direction (+ COORD_TRANSFORM) for better visibility 
  (two overlaid curves span the full y-range; axis labels set to true values,
       which may or may not be similar for both plots).
  • shift_ydata.pro

OVERLAYS:
  • oplot_background.pro
  • oplot_flare_lines.pro
  • oplot_shaded.pro



GOES:

  • goes.pro
      -> creates GOES object ('gdata') by calling OGOES()
          at user specifed times (string variables "tstart" and "tend")
  • plot_goes.pro
      -> subroutine (function definition only, no ML code afterward)
           with 'gdata' as only argument (besides "buffer" kw).



----

  • utplot.pro
          ☆ ★ ☆  Code copied from interwebs, NOT my own work!  ☆ ★ ☆ 

  • plot_lc_SDO-GUIDE.pro
     -> calls utplot.pro

RHESSI:

    • plot_rhessi.pro

No clue:

  • aia_flare_start_end_times.pro
      -> Last modified 28 November 2018 !!
          "Big ugly light curves", according to my own comments
          (may be similar to "plot_lightcurve_reference.pro",
            for my own use, not for sharing).
      Documentation is poor, borderline non-existant... 
         doesn't seem too important or useful at current stage of this dissertation project...
