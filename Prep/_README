04 April 2020:
    Two files copied to preserve code:
      1. struc_MLcode_OLD.pro (initially called "extra.pro")
      2. struc_aia_OLD.pro
    Moved to ../.old/ since probably not needed, but may be worth looking over
    just for kicks. May have eliminated code that isn't as useless as I thought.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Routines in "work"/Prep/:


  • prep_data.pro
    - ??

  • get_jd.pro
    - short subroutine that takes timestampstring as input, and uses
       IDL procedure TIMESTAMPTOVALUES to generate and
       return Julian Date (what form?)
  • get_time.pro
    - also fairly short, takes JD as input and uses
        IDL procedure CALDAT to get parsed values of year, month, day, etc. and
        returns "hh:mm:ss.dd" (string)


  • apply_aia_prep.pro
    - ML routine to read fits files, set output directory for prepped files,
        and run aia_prep
    - runs script "parameters"
    - Includes sample file names of both prepped and UNprepped fits files
        from AIA and HMI.
   18 July 2022 ==> moved two old versions from 5/8/2020 and 1/5/2021
       ( apply_aia_prep_20200508.pro and apply_aia_prep_20210105.pro)
       to ../old/

  • data_struc.pro
    - general code for creating array of structures for either AIA or HMI.
  • extra.pro
    - separate routine to add instrument-specific tags/values to a structure
    - Allows the use of a general routine to initiate array of structures "A"
        for ANY data set, regardless of instrument/channel. Then use extra.pro
        to add extras (hence the name) such as standard AIA colors (HMI does not
        appear to have color tables for each data type, as far as I can tell,
        so in the past, regular black and white or greyscale was set as default).
    - Appears to run routines to compute P(t) from flux and maps
        (get_power_from_flux.pro and get_power_from_maps.pro)
        which is not done in struc_aia.pro.
  • struc_aia.pro
    - create array of structures "A" for AIA alone.
  • struc_hmi.pro
    - create array of structures "H" for HMI alone.
    - No ML code at the moment (23 July 2019)

NOTES:

Mon Jul 22 22:49:22 MDT 2019
  - Moved align_data.pro, spikes.pro, and plot_num_saturated_pixels.pro
    from Prep/ to Align/.

Wed Jan 23 19:27:50 MST 2019
  - Ideally, prep_hmi.pro and prep_aia.pro would be combined into one routine
      since they're so similar.
  - Currently using the two separate routines since having them combined would
      be "nice", but not high priority right now.
