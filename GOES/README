Subroutines in GOES directory

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    goes.pro --> NOT MINE! This was copied from the internet.
                   I should try to make my filenames more unique...
                   Or move stuff I didn't write to a common directory that doesn't
                   contain any of my own stuff.
    CORRECTION: I did write this, but copied a bunch of text from the webpage
       explaining how to use it and commented it all out.
     "OGOES()" is the name of the external routine.
       Useful reference, but possibly misleading.



------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following subroutines definitely are mine :)

    plot_goes_2.pro

    plot_goes_subroutine.pro
        This is from the time I consolidated a bunch of codes together,
        many of which contained a lot of ML code. That code was placed
        in a subroutine, and any routine called by the previously ML code
        was appended with "_subroutine" so I would know it was a subroutine
        even when that bit of code was separated out from everything else.

    oplot_goes.pro
        This is never actually called from the ML code in the same file...
        I think I tried using IDL's plot procedure rather than functions
        when first learning how to plot data with GOES, then got fed up
        with it and went back to the object-oriented style.
