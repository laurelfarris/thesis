"work"/GOES/

    goes.pro
        Copied code from interwebs, along with explanations of how to use it (commented)
        OGOES() --> external routine.

    my_goes.pro
        ML code only, 
        plt = PLOT_GOES( gdata, buffer=buffer )

    plot_goes.pro
        function definition ONLY (no ML code);
        called by my_goes.pro

    oplot_goes.pro
        procedure definition only (no ML code),
        not called from any other routine in this directory.
        This is probably not needed.
