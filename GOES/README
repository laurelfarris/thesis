"work"/GOES/

    goes.pro
        Copied code from interwebs, along with explanations of how to use it (commented)
        OGOES() --> external routine.

    plot_goes.pro
        function definition plus ML code, which calls function defined above:
            plt = PLOT_GOES( gdata, buffer=buffer )

    oplot_goes.pro
        procedure definition only (no ML code),
        not called from any other routine in this directory.
        This is probably not needed.

    plot_goes_OLD_20210603.pro
        Copied to preserve old stuff since last modified date was over two years ago...
