"Modules/" currently contains codes I did NOT write, and don't
necessarily use. Not sure how to organize codes yet.
see "other/" for stuff I DID write.



aia_read_psf.pro ... "/IS_PROCEDURE"  (16 March 2020)
    input : fnames of image and inversePSF (both existing fits?),
      and optional kw "kernal"
    output : index, data
  procedure applies psf correction, then final step before returning to caller
    is to run aia_prep
  --> probably don't need psf correction for my data (double check SDO guide
    to make sure) but maybe good example for running aia_prep within another
    routine, in addition to other data prep or corrections that ARE relevant
    and necessary for my data.
    My equivalent is in Prep/, called "apply_aia_prep.pro", and runs at
    ML... should write a procedure or function, if possible.
