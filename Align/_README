[] Re-name codes to something more descriptive of each
NOTE: there may be duplicates of subroutines inside multiple .pro files

------------------------------------------------------------------------
My codes:


  • align_data.pro
    - Loops through align_cube3.pro until stddev of shifts stops decreasing
  • shift_coords.pro
    - align first and last image in time series and
        use total pixel shift over full dt to calculate estimation of
        distance traveled by the AR across the solar disk, in arcseconds.
    - NOTE: this routine uses main alignment routines to get pixel count,
         but is not required for the actual alignment of data cube


For less-than-straightforward alignment (i.e. saturated pixels):
  • align_in_pieces.pro
    - Lots of subroutines for dealing with skewed alignment due to saturation.
    - NOTE: duplicate of align_data procedure is included here
  • align_interp.pro
    - interpolate good shifts to estimate/replace bad ones
        (similar to procedure I use to estimate images missing from raw data cube)
  • plot_num_saturated_pixels.pro
    - ML code that plots #saturated pixels as function of z-index (I think).
    - Could be useful even if alignment runs smoothly... but I'm listing it with
        the other routines for skewy alignment to keep from getting confused.
  • spikes.pro
    - IMAGE saturated images (bleeding looks "spiky"


------------------------------------------------------------------------
codes I did NOT write:
  • align_cube3.pro
  • alignoffset.pro
  • shift_sub.pro
