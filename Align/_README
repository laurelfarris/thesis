lots of code here... need to merge, move to OLD/, or something...
[] ==>> at least comment and explain what each one does!

See ~/idl/original_files/ for main alignment routines
(aka the ones I didn't write).

  Deleted codes I didn't write... they're in ~/idl/Modules/ if I need
  to look at the code.
  Also deleted directory Original_codes/ because everything was a duplicate
  of files in ~/idl/original_files/

My codes:

  • align_loop.pro
    - Loops through align_cube3.pro until stddev of shifts stops decreasing
    - (5/05/2020) --> .sav files created for SHIFTS and modified CUBE
                    NOTE: see COMMENTS in align_loop.pro for explanation of
                    extra files (aia1600new_shifts, etc.)
                    Also, comment block at top of code includes breakdown of
                    alignment procedure into 5 steps; beginning with reading
                    the data from fits files and ending with saving aligned
                    data (and shifts) to .sav files.
        
  • shift_coords.pro
    - align first and last image in time series and
        use total pixel shift over full dt to calculate estimation of
        distance traveled by the AR across the solar disk, in arcseconds.
    - NOTE: this routine uses main alignment routines to get pixel count,
         but is not required for the actual alignment of data cube

For less-than-straightforward alignment (i.e. saturated pixels):
  • align_in_pieces.pro
    - Lots of subroutines for dealing with skewed alignment due to saturation.
    - NOTE: duplicate of align_data procedure is included here
  • align_interp.pro
    - interpolate good shifts to estimate/replace bad ones
        (similar to procedure I use to estimate images missing from raw data cube)
  • plot_num_saturated_pixels.pro
    - ML code that plots #saturated pixels as function of z-index (I think).
    - Could be useful even if alignment runs smoothly... but I'm listing it with
        the other routines for skewy alignment to keep from getting confused.
  • spikes.pro
    - IMAGE saturated images (bleeding looks "spiky"
