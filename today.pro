;-  Using same values for ROI center and rr (length of polygon side) from
;-    previous "today.pro" that created LC by averaging over a few pixels centered
;-    on the ROI, smoothing LC, etc, etc.
;-  Task for this code is probably simpler, just need to produce image of power
;-    map (also from previous today.pro) and overlay an arrow using IDL's
;-    ARROW function. See E-note for details on calling syntax, kws, etc,
;-    Greenie, p. 110. for diagrams & examples, and
;-   IDL coding note "2020-01-24.pro" (note that since the dates in the comments
;-     in that code are 19 and 23 January, so filename may change, but shld be able
;-     to find using grep command to search for "arrow" in the text.
;-
;- PURPOSE: overlay ARROW graphic on power map (any map), pointing at
;-   "interesting features" ... does not have to perfect or pretty (yet).

;- User-defined values
;-


dz = 64

;- center coords of ROI
center = [382,192]

;- dimensions of (square) polygon centered on ROI;
;-  contains the pixels spatially averaged to obtain LCs (see previous today.pro),
;-   for a total area = rr x rr square pixels.
rr = 10

;- index of power map to image, where map was obtained from FFT of
;-   data from z_ind to z_ind+dz-1.
z_ind = 201

;-  'offset' = distance between ROI center and tip of arrow
offset = 5

;-  'arrow_mag' = "magnitude" of the arrow (length of arrow shaft).
arrow_mag = 20

;- general code (no user input required)

x0 = center[0]
y0 = center[1]

;title = A[cc].name + ' 3-minute power (' + time[z_ind] + ' - ' + time[z_ind+dz-1] + ')' ,$
;-   title kw passed to image2 (below) in following form each iteration:
;-
;- Title now defined outside image loop so that call to IMAGE is less cluttered.
;-



title = A.name + ' 3-minute power (' + time[z_ind] + ' - ' + time[z_ind+dz-1] + ')'
help, title
;-   title should be 2-element string array. If not, this won't work. (05 March 2020)

;- 'xycomp' = length of the x and y vector components of the arrow
;-    (sloppy variable name, but all I can come up with right now).
;-  Value is calculated from arrow_mag using Pythagorean theorem, and determines
;-   x1 and y1 (the coords of the arrow end not pointing at the ROI).
xycomp = sqrt( (arrow_mag^2)/2 )


;- X and Y args for ARROW function (endpoint coords of arrow graphic).
x2 = x0 + offset
y2 = y0 - offset
x1 = x2 + xycomp
y1 = y2 - xycomp
