  renamed batch_plot_2.pro to batch_plot_2_OLD_20200613.pro because
  it's bascially a duplicate of ../Graphics/batch_plot_2.pro with lines
  added to create 2nd x-axis (ax[2]) and y-axis (ax[3])
  by calling IDL AXIS function
  (actually calls my routine AXIS2.pro, but close enough).
  These axes are now created AFTER call to batch_plot routine
  in plot_pt.pro, rather than having the same subroutine create them
  after plotting the main curves on ax[0] and ax[1].
  Long story short, don't need duplicate batch_plot_2.pro when there's already
  one in ../Graphics/, and not many modifications were made.
  Sloppy coding... not even going to start tryign to figure out difference
  between batch_plot_2.pro and batch_plot.pro, (both in Graphics/).
  At least not today...

plot_pt.pro vs plot_pt_2.pro
    IGNORE 2nd version ("*_2.pro") for now.
    Is not called by any other codes in this directory
    (based on results of grep -li "plot_pt")

get_power_from_maps.pro vs get_power_from_maps_Subroutine.pro
    Latter was previously get_power_from_maps_2.pro, and was
    located one directory up, in the main Codes/ dir. on mac
    (/ss/laurel07/thesis/ on dept. computer).
    Appears to be attempt at using a subroutine instead of doing
    everything at the main level.
    Abandon this for now.
