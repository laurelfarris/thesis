plot_pt.pro vs plot_pt_2.pro
    IGNORE 2nd version ("*_2.pro") for now.
    Is not called by any other codes in this directory
    (based on results of grep -li "plot_pt")

get_power_from_maps.pro vs get_power_from_maps_Subroutine.pro
    Latter was previously get_power_from_maps_2.pro, and was
    located one directory up, in the main Codes/ dir. on mac
    (/ss/laurel07/thesis/ on dept. computer).
    Appears to be attempt at using a subroutine instead of doing
    everything at the main level.
    Abandon this for now.
