%%\subsection{Power maps} ... ? maybe.

The following section first discusses powermap results that were
consistent throughout the time series, followed by before, during, and after the
X-class flare.



Figures~\ref{before}, \ref{during}, and \ref{after}
each show intensity images and corresponding
spatial distibution of the 3-minute power
in AIA 1600\AA{} and AIA 1700\AA{}
before, during, and after the X-class flare, respectively.
The contours overlaid on each image represent the
HMI $B_{LOS}$ magnetogram at $\pm$300 Gauss,
which corresponds
closely with the boundary of the outer penumbra.
This also helps to identify possible correlations between
oscillatory power and magnetic field strength.
Both the contour data and the intensity maps were
obtained by averaging over the same time segment 
from which the power map was computed.
(It should be noted that the alignment procedures may have resulted in a slight
offset between the channels, in addition to any existing LOS affects.)

The particular time segments presented here
were chosen based on the presence of interesting features
in the power maps
or distinct patterns in the light curve.
Several key observations in the spatial distribution of
3-minute power
were relatively consistent throughout the time series.


% Power contained in AR, not network/internetwork
The power appears constrained to the immediate vicinity of the
active region; there is very little enhancement beyond this
(examination of the isolated power maps outside the active region
confirmed that this was not merely a visual scaling effect).


% Suppression of power over umbra center.
The 3-minute power tends to be suppressed directly over the center of the umbra,
with a ring-like pattern of enhanced power around the edges of the umbra,
similar to results from \cite{Reznikova2012} for AIA UV emission.

% SMALL regions of enhanced power
Power enhancement occurs in relatively small regions.
For example, in Figure~\ref{before}, there is a distinct bright spot
with high power along the lower edge of the penumbra boundary
of AR\_1p, with an area of $\sim6"\times6"$.

The concentration of power enhancement in small areas
located in the vicinity of sunspot umbrae suggests that
\correction{these small areas of} the chromosphere
are responding directly to the injection of energy by
a beam of non-thermal particles.
%\mynote{Umbral brightenings/dots?}


% Power and Intensity - same location
Locations of enhanced power tended to have high intensity in
the corresponding intensity image.
However, enhanced power did not necessarily appear in
every location of high intensity.
This is most clearly visible in AIA 1600\AA{}.


% Power correlation with magnetic field strength
The regions of enhanced 3-minute power
were usually located along the boundaries of magnetic field
strength at $\pm$300 Gauss,
approximately over the outer penumbra boundary.

% Spots appear and disappear in one place, no navigating.
The location of these enhancements does not move across the AR.
Rather, it remains in one place until it fades away.
One of the most prominent locations of enhanced power occurs before
the flare at the bottom of the leading sunspot in the northern pair.
The change in location with time of both flare intensity and 3-minute power
implies that the source of the beam of non-thermal particles changes as well.

Although this time segment took place during the precursor phase
of the X-class flare, it also took place
\emph{after} a C-class flare that occurred an hour before the X-flare,
between 00:30 and 00:45 UT,
as well as another event the day before on 10 February 2011.
%\mynote{How might C-flare have affected these results?

The emission from the C-flare originated from AR\_2n.

The prominent region of enhanced power along the lower penumbral

Interestingly, the C-flare occurred on the opposite side of
AR 11158.
Movies of the active region intensity leading up to the X-flare reveal

of $T$, the enhancement in power was consistently present in the power maps.

Future work will involve the investigation into
the magnetic configuration of this region and
potential connections between this spot and earlier events.
Locations of enhanced power are, for the most part, located along
umbra/penumbra boundaries, though a ribbon-like shape through the
center of AR\_1n is also observed.

        \label{during}}
\end{figure*}


Figure~\ref{during}
shows intensity images and corresponding power maps for
the time segment between 01:45 and 02:10 UT,
just after the \textit{GOES} start time (01:44 UT) until
a few minutes after the \textit{GOES} end time (02:06 UT).
This covered the maximum amount of
flare emission: from the start of the impulsive phase through as much
of the decay phase as allowed by $T$.
Pixels that saturated were excluded from the maps
to improve contrast between the remaining pixels.
%Bleeding that occurred at the edges of saturated areas could not
%be excluded since these values started to approach those held

Due to the short timescales over which flare dynamics typically occur,
the instrumental sampling rate here is
too low to obtain sufficient time resolution.
The sampling time $T\approx$25 minutes used here
did not allow the isolation of any one flare phase
as it was a few minutes longer than the entire duration between
the official \textit{GOES} start and end times.
(about 22 minutes).
While the choice of $T$ was necessary to obtain sufficient frequency resolution,
this does come
at the expense of temporal resolution.
The enhanced emission at the 3-minute period in integrated emission
observed by \cite{Milligan2017} appeared to start around 01:44 and faded
beyond the 99\% confidence limit by $\sim$02:02, with slightly enhanced
power beyond this until $\sim$02:10 in AIA 1700\AA{}.
These timescales over which the oscillatory power changed
were much shorter than the sample time length used here.

Due to the large number of pixels that saturated during the flare,
not much spatial information can be extracted from power maps obtained
during the time that enhanced chromospheric emission was previously observed.
peak flare emission, particularly
from the AR center and parts of the outside sunspots, where
emission reaches further into as the flare develops.
According to the review from \cite{Inglis2009}, QPPs in flare emission
often don't last longer than three or four periods, so
extracting these oscillations would be difficult even without
saturation with the current methods.

It can be observed that the spot in AR\_1p fades away in the power maps
obtained from gradual phase only (no emission from precursor or impulsive
phases contributing to power map).


For the current data set, the peak in AIA emission occurred around
01:53 UT (01:52:41.12 for 1600\AA{}, and 01:52:55.71 for 1700\AA{}),
about 3 minutes before the \textit{GOES} peak time (01:56 UT).
Both UV light curves show a slight increase at the \textit{GOES} end time
(02:06), as well as a few other times during the decay phase.

\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{after}
shows post-flare intensity images and corresponding power maps for
the time segment between 03:00 and 03:25,
well into the gradual phase of the x-flare.
This time period includes the first of two small events that occurred
after the X-class flare within the five-hour time series.

This particular time segment was chosen to present as the post-flare
oscillatory power because of the presence of several distinct, small
regions of enhancement in the center,
right around AR\_2p.

%Enhanced intensity and 3-minute power are observed along the lower
%boundary of AR\_2n, as well as along the lower boundary

Almost all events before and after the main X-class flare
occurred in AR\_2n, including briefly at the beginning of the time series.



% Damping behavior of 3-minute oscillations (maybe)
3-minute oscillations are interpreted as slow, propagating magnetoacoustic waves,
which have a characteristic excitation mechanism and damping rate,
depending on the local plasma conditions where they originate.
The timescales over which the oscillatory power is expected to change
depends on the nature of the oscillations themselves,
or maybe the cooling rate of the plasma.
The expected timescales would depend on the cooling rate of the plasma
(images) and the damping time/mechanisms of the 3-minute oscillations.
