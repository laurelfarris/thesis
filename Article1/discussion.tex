The concentration of power enhancement in small areas
located in the vicinity of sunspot umbrae suggests that
\correction{these small areas of} the chromosphere
are responding directly to the injection of energy by
a beam of non-thermal particles.
\mynote{Umbral brightenings/dots?}

If the location of power enhancement does reveal sites of energy injection,
then \correction{it remains possible that} changes in energy source coincides
with the location of power changes.

    Compare my results from integrated emission to others.
    Then compare my results from spatially resolved data.
    Does it contradict those from integrated emission?
    Do the \emph{relative} changes in the two AIA channels match?
