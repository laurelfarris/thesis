IDEA : Put my "modules" in main "work" directory (alias='work' from @solarstorm)
        at least the ones I'm actively using for whatever Figure(s) I'm creating
        for the current "Project of the week".


     •  Sub-directories all contain various types of computations/figures/SCIENCE,
        some of which are ML routines, some are subroutines,
        many of them call one or several of the others,
        These directories are good places to preserve ALL versions of similar codes,
        test codes, well-established subroutines that I don't need to look at very often
        (there aren't many of these, unfortunately),
        as many different variations and experiments as I neeed to spit out
        until I uncover the approach that works best for given application.
        Then move "the better way" up one level to the main work dir.
        Can alos have lots of graphic-creating code here.


     •  Main WORK dir. can then be kept relatively clutter-free, and
        only need to work with codes that are right there, rather than
        constantly jumping back and forth between all the sub-directories
        nested here.
